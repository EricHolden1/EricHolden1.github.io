<p>Loose flanges are usually the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws merely will not keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best option depends upon the level of the rot. Use an ear-type repair ring if the rot is only under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into company wood further away from the flange. Prior to you install this sort of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may have to cut off a number of ears to make it deal with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll need to replace a section of the subfloor.</p>
