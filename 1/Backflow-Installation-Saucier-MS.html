After we have actually cleaned the body, and the repaired elements are still out of the body, and we have completed all of our part replacement and cleaning, we should open the inlet turned off to flush any rust or debris. This can be difficult, especially when the backflow prevention assembly is set up inside an area where water can not be splashed around.
