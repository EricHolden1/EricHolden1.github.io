<p>Polybutylene utilized inside your home can be discovered near the hot water heater or coming out of the walls to feed toilets or sinks. Caution: some plumbers set up stub outs" of copper when leaving the wall. Due to the fact that copper is revealing does not mean you do not have polybutylene pipes, simply. You might have to make a little hole in the drywall to see the connection.</p>
<p>Remove itchy rashes and experience smoother, softer skin and hair with a point-of-use shower head water softener. These models connect to or replace your existing shower head to balance the pH of your water, stop scale from forming, and filter out minerals. Many people dump food waste in the garbage, which indicates more garbage to go in garbage dumps or be incinerated. Besides being bad for the environment, it's often stinky and typically utilizes plastic bags to carry the waste. Worse, food waste can ferment in landfills rather of breaking down.</p>
<p>We offer service for both residential and commercial clients. Call 804-358-1616.
