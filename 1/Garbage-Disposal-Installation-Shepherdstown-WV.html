<h3>Tips For Finding An Emergency Plumber Shepherdstown WV</h3>

<h3>Water Heater Installation and Repair Tips in Shepherdstown WV</h3>
<p>Low hot water pressure? Our knowledgeable plumbers can identify and fix your low water pressure issue. Indications of corrosion or scale buildup on components may indicate past leakages and high pressure. If there is a bigger issue needing attention, this can lead plumbers to examine. Dealing with gas is extremely harmful, and it is very important to turn off the line to enable a safe repair procedure.</p>
<p>If you're purchasing a new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge majority of toilets, the waste pipe is centered about 12 in. from the wall. But with a couple of designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, simply determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in.. Most house centers bring only one or 2 10-in. models and no 14-in. models. If you need to special-order a toilet, be prepared to spend much more. If there's a door near the toilet, also measure how far the bowl extends from the wall. If you are changing a toilet with a standard bowl with an extended" design, the door may not close. Keep reading to discover how to install a toilet.</p>
