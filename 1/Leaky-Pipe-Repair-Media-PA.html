<p>Backflow is dangerous because it can pollute the general public drinking supply with contaminants like fertilizers, pesticides, human waste, and hazardous chemicals. In 2010, for example, students at a Bowling Green, Kentucky elementary school suffered nausea and other symptoms after a contractor working on the HVAC system triggered the antifreeze chemical glycol to backflow into the school's drinking supply.</p>
<p>The client has one month to finish installation and testing of a backflow prevention assembly (examine the due date on Notification of Requirements form). The majority of the time, a professional plumber can come out and discover the problem and make the repairs. In some circumstances, the toilet may be too old, and replacement parts are not readily available, so a replacement toilet is required.</p>
