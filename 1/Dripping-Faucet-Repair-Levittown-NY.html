<p>A. The toilet fill valve measurements we reveal are determined from the within bottom of the tank to the top of the fill valve. The threaded supply of water shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not consisted of in this measurement. The addition of a backflow preventer decreases water service pressure to the building; extra, more significant expenses can happen if the drop in water pressure becomes a concern for citizens.
