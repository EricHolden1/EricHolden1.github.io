<h3>How To Repair Your Water Heater at Aptos CA</h3>
<p>Corrosion is a complex phenomenon and there are lots of factors that accelerate deterioration in the drinking-water circulation system and property plumbing. For several years, there has been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and rust, making it important to compare naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is destructive as it has a low pH and low TDS; nevertheless, cation -exchange water softening does not contribute to any elements that speed up rust Likewise, there is a lack of clinical proof supporting the claim that hard-water scale is an efficient kind of corrosion control. Thus, thinking about all these aspects, as well as results from research studies, WQA's position is that a correctly configured cation -exchange water softener does not make water more corrosive.</p>
