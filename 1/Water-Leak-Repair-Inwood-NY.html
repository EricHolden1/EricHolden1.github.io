<h3>Everything You Need To Know About A Blocked Drain in Inwood NY</h3>
<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to operate, the control valve or valves should stay open and the system must be continually kept track of. For that reason, there is a device on each control valve that either prevents the valve from being closed or sends an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as easy as a locked chain through the control valve that prevents that valve from opening, or an alarm that informs the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems make use of both approaches. NFPA 13 describes all such gadgets as supervisory devices.</p>
