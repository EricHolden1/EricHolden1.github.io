I actually got their number for another company that could not come quickly enough but referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to investigate and offer me a price quote. They immediately cleared the preliminary obstruction, permitting the renters to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon further examination, there was a considerable blockage that needed excavation to examine. His group was on site the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this preliminary issue and setting up a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This took place yet a third time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
