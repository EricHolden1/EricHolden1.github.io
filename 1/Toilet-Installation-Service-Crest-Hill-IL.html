The average cost to install a gas line for a kitchen stove is $15 to $25 per direct foot. Total expenses vary from $200 to $1,000 or more depending upon the length of piping required to connect to the main gas supply, which normally averages 30'.</p>
<p>Release piping linked to a storm sewer shall be equipped with backwater check valve. In commercial applications, for example, AWWA M-14: Backflow Prevention and Cross-Connection Control Recommended Practices recommends a DCV assembly on damp or dry lawn sprinkler unless there is a risk of a high-hazard cross-connection. In those cases, an RPZ assembly is suggested.</p>
<p>It may be time to get it replaced if your water heater has needed several repairs over the last couple of years.

If the cost of a repair is more than half the cost of a replacement at that point, then it makes more monetary sense to replace your water heater.</p>

We offer inspections that provide you assurance while keeping you ahead of repairs.
