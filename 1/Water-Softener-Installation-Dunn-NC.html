If the water level is below the top of television, the flush valve is leaking, allowing water to trickle into the bowl. That sluggish, continuous outflow of water prevents the fill valve from closing entirely. We removed the fronts and backs of brand-new toilets to show you how to replace these toilet tank parts.
