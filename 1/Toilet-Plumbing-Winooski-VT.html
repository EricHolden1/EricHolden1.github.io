<p>Won't drain - The unit might not be chopping food correctly and waste might have clogged the drain pipe. Nevertheless, if there are a number of leakages within the system, or if there is evidence of rust in a number of locations, it is probably time to repipe. A water softener is loaded with resin beads. Tough water with calcium and magnesium streams through this resin and, in a process called ion exchange, the hardness ions in the water trade places with soft ions on the resin beads. The outcome is soft water.</p>
<p>A water softener ought to be installed as near to the water's point of entry into the house as possible. This ensures most of your plumbing and appliances are profiting of carrying the softened water. It's specifically essential to make sure your water softener is located before your water heater, as difficult water does the greatest damage to hot water devices. You will want to install the softener in a dry, level area, like a basement or garage. It will need to be near to the water's main line, an electrical outlet to switch on the system, and a drain for the brine solution from the regeneration cycle.</p>
<p>Chelation: Another approach is to introduce a chemical compound that acts as a chelating agent. Magnesium and calcium bind to this chelating agent and remain suspended in the water rather than developing on surface areas. However, if they stay in one location for long, as they may in a water heater, the buildup might still happen.</p>
