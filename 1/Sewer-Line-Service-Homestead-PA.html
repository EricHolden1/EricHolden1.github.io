We have decades of experience in setting up and fixing toilets, and we  wish to remain for another couple of years helping individuals like you and your family.</p>
<p>If you're purchasing a brand-new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge majority of toilets, the drain is focused about 12 in. from the wall. But with a couple of designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, just determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in.. The majority of home centers carry only one or 2 10-in. models and no 14-in. designs. Be prepared to invest much more if you have to special-order a toilet. If there's a door near the toilet, likewise determine how far the bowl protrudes from the wall. If you are changing a toilet with a standard bowl with a lengthened" model, the door might not close. Read on to find out how to install a toilet.</p>
<p>A backflow preventer is a method or system to avoid backflow. The basic means of avoiding backflow is an air gap, which either gets rid of a cross-connection or supplies a barrier to backflow. The standard mechanism for avoiding backflow is a mechanical backflow preventer, which offers a physical barrier to backflow. The principal types of mechanical backflow preventer are the reduced-pressure concept assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the check valve assembly. A secondary kind of mechanical backflow preventer is the residential double check valve.</p>
<p>A check backflow preventer includes 2 spring-loaded check assemblies to prevent back siphonage and back pressure on non-health risk (low hazard) systems. Loosen the coupling nut that links the supply line. If the toilet valve turns inside the toilet tank, hold its base with a locking pliers. Suggestion: Toss a towel on the floor beneath to capture water that will drain from the line.</p>
