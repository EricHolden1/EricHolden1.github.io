<p>The majority of disposals will last in between 10 and 12 years prior to needing replacement. Signs that your disposal requires to be changed include requiring to push the reset button regularly, the blades no longer slicing up the waste well or taking longer to slice up the waste, leaking from the bottom of the unit, frequent obstructions, or noticeable rust on the system itself.</p>
