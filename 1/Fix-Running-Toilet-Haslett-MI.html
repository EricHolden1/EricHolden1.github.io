<p>The Last Jeopardy response, you ask? The device that manages water flow in your toilet. You'll see a supply line that runs from the outlet in the wall to the bottom of the toilet fill valve if you look behind your toilet. This is how water gets into your toilet. After you flush the toilet, the fill valve opens to refill the water in the toilet and the tank bowl, readying the system for the next flush.

Our comprehensive water quality program runs 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, to guarantee that the water delivered to our customers is kept free from harmful contaminants.
