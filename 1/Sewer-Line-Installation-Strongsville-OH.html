Requirements for training vary by jurisdiction. Inspection of backflow preventers requires understanding of installation requirements, although inspectors are not required to end up being certified.</p>
<p>Other pipe repair methods include our Pipe Pull method and pipe relining. The Pipe Pull technique interchanges damaged sewer or water lines with brand-new piping by the use of a small hole at the front and back of the piping run. The broken sewer line guides the brand-new piping into place. All brand-new replacement pipes have a predicted life-span of one hundred years and are code certified, chemical-resistant, root-resistant, and leak evidence. Another effective method is pipe relining. Pipe relining basically gets rid of the need for broken pipe removal. By placing a solidifying lining material which coats the inside of the existing pipe, a new pipe is produced inside the broken one.</p>
