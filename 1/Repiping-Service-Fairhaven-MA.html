<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean water supply pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in safe and clean water system pressure occur whenever the amount of water being used surpasses the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
