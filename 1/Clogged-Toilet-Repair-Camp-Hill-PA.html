<h3>The Importance of Drain Cleaning and How it Affects Your Home in Camp Hill PA</h3>
<p>. Backflow into a public water system can contaminate or infect the water in that system (i.e., backflow into a public water supply can make the water because system unusable or unsafe to consume), and each water provider has a duty to supply water that is functional and safe to drink under all foreseeable scenarios. Additionally, consumers generally have absolute faith that water delivered to them through a public water supply is always safe to drink. For these reasons, your water district should take precautions to safeguard its public water system against backflow.</p>

<p>Recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line between their new home and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we utilized our sewer camera to examine the line and identify the reason for the problem. The line was plainly deteriorating; some sections were just held together by the ground around them. Another clog impended. Even worse, the line might collapse requiring a major repair or replacement.</p>
