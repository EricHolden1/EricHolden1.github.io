<p>If you're buying a brand-new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large majority of toilets, the waste pipe is focused about 12 in. from the wall. However with a couple of models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, just determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in.. The majority of house centers carry only one or two 10-in. designs and no 14-in. designs. If you need to special-order a toilet, be prepared to invest a lot more. If there's a door near the toilet, also determine how far the bowl extends from the wall. If you are changing a toilet with a basic bowl with a lengthened" design, the door may not close.
