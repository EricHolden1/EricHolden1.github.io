<p>When choosing the proper system protection there are numerous factors to consider we need to take a look at. In my mind there is no one size fits all scenarios in the cross-connection world. Each and every installation needs to be taken a look at on an individual basis as a special stand-alone system. The National Fire Security Association NFPA 13 Requirement for the installation of sprinkler systems consists of the requirement for the lawn sprinkler themselves. Fire defense system are designed to match the risk that exists in the locations they are installed in. As structure types and contents of these buildings can be very different, we need to comprehend that the fire protection system for any installation requires to be developed and set up to fulfill that particular danger or need. An aircraft hangar will need a really different fire security system than the system needed in an apartment. The backflow security requirements for these 2 examples would also differ considerably.</p>
