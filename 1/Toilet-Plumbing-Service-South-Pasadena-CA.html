<p>House water softeners, also called ion exchange units, are devices that get rid of calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for sodium or potassium. Once the resin beads end up being filled with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium service removes the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After travelling through the beads, the resulting chloride option becomes a waste stream that goes down the drain and ultimately into the environment.</p>
<p>While UPC does differentiate in between commercial and residential systems, its leniency only applies to residential systems using drinkable water piping materials.

<p>Throughout normal operation, the pressure in between the two check valves, referred to as the zone of reduced pressure, is preserved at a lower pressure than the supply pressure. If either check valve should leak, the relief valve is developed to release and open water to the outside. An RPZ will regularly release percentages of water due to variation in line pressure up or downstream of the assembly. For this reason, the RPZ needs to be set up in areas that are exempt to water damage and permit adequate drainage.</p>
