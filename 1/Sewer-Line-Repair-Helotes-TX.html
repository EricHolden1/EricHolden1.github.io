If an GFAVB is utilized backflow prevention on an irrigation system you must install one GFAVB after every valve for each zone in the system.  It should also be installed a minimum of 6 inches (150 mm) greater than the highest outlet in the system (some GFAVB makers, and some local authorities, need that they be set up 12 inches (300 mm) greater than the greatest outlet).
