<p>Woodbury, in addition to lots of other communities and companies, has found the very best method to avoid these spots from taking place is by reducing the variety of times your water softener regrows. "Restoring" refers to the method softeners clean all the calcium and magnesium mineral deposits out of the filter medium when it ends up being "tired" or full. Nevertheless, many water softeners regenerate frequently, when the filter medium really isn't full. This can be corrected by simply resetting your water softener to get rid of less hardness or to run longer between regrowth cycles.</p>
