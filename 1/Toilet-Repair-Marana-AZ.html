Worms for watering systems: Homeowners discovered parasitical worms (nematodes) in their water after the air pressure breaker malfunctioned on a privately owned underground sprinkler system. Throughout a water pressure drop, the vacuum in the system drew some water from the sprinkler into the city water. The house owner discovered worms swimming in the bathtub while filling it to bathe his kid.</p>
<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the usual solution is to have the malfunctioning pipes changed. Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping is available in.

Steel was the most popular choice for house plumbing for lots of decades, however steel eventually experiences corrosion and does not have the sturdiness of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
