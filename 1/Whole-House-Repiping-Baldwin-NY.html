<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health danger for individuals on low salt diet plans. Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to reduce its mineral material. Usually, this process adds 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending on how hard the water was to begin with. Harder water will result in more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this boost in sodium is small, but if you've been recommended by a medical professional to follow a strict low sodium diet this boost can pose problems.</p>
