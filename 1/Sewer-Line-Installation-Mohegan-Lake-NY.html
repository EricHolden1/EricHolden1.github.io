Several back-ups generally indicate your sewage system is failing.

<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is only half the formula! To just pour some media inside a tank and expect the best is typical in our market and numerous companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Once again, years of experience and comprehensive testing led us to design a tank that fluidizes the media bed better than any other design on the market. Fluidization is the essential to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media transforms the solidity in the water to calcite crystals which will not adhere to anything even under extreme temperature levels. It's just with the media and the fluidization effectively working together that you can accomplish this.</p>
