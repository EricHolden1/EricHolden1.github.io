<p>When compared to gas designs, electric models are easier and less costly to install as electrical power is already offered through the main power supply line. For gas water heaters, a particular gas line has to be set up and a feasible source of gas established. Another feature of an electric water heater is that they do not need any ventilation. Gas models need to be ventilated correctly utilizing vents and ducts in order to function correctly. With electrical models, you will not need to install any new vents or ducts in your house.</p>
<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health risk for people on low sodium diets. Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to decrease its mineral content. Usually, this process includes 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending on how hard the water was to start with. Harder water will lead to more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this increase in sodium is minor, but if you've been encouraged by a medical professional to follow a rigorous low salt diet this increase can pose problems.</p>

<p>In water distribution systems, water is usually kept at a substantial pressure to make it possible for water to stream from the tap, shower, or other fixture. Water pressure may stop working or be decreased when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is unexpectedly high need on the water system (for example, when a number of fire hydrants are opened). Reduced pressure in the pipe may permit infected water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be prepared into the system.</p>
<p>Water solidity is the amount of liquified calcium and magnesium in the water-- difficult water is high in both calcium and magnesium. The reason you can feel the distinction on your skin is since soap responds with the calcium to form soap scum. This results in the need for more soap or detergent to get things clean. Which's where the term solidity" originated from ... it's hard to clean in.</p>
