<p>In some cases, our technicians will advise that you replace your hot water heater rather than buy repairs. This is usually the case when the water heater is more than 10 years old or the cost of repairs would total majority the cost of an entire new unit. Sometimes a problematic toilet just requires a small modification and life is back to regular.
