<h3>Commercial Plumbing Services, Available 24/7 Saint Helena CA</h3>
<p>PEX pipes were believed to be a much better alternative to galvanized and polybutylene piping. Unfortunately, one brand name is experiencing a lot of problems: Dura PEX. Dura PEX tends to have a lot of oxidization. This triggers cracks in the tubing that can lead to leaks. As these leakages take place, zinc is seeped from the fittings on the pipes, triggering them to degrade. Lastly, chlorinated water has been found to trigger cracks in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the very best service to all of these issues.</p>
