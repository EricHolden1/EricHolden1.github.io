Water enters the consumer facility via a water meter that tape-records flow rates and water usage for billing functions. Private service pipelines are normally made from plastic, type or lead K copper. And it is here at the point of application where the installation of a backflow preventer can be vital.</p>

<p>Installation and replacement expenses are often equivalent, though replacement usually will not need additional charges, such as application costs. New meters need to satisfy regulations and code requirements for their positioning, and gas companies might need an unique meter for their services, limiting your choices.
