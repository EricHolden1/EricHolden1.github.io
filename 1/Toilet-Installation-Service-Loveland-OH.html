<p>For shallow pipes without any nearby energies or obstructions, digging through and changing the pipe manually would likely be more affordable than relining it internally. However, if your damaged pipe runs under your driveway, any big trees or pathways, dig-free pipe lining could conserve you as much as $10,000 in repair expenses, if not more. Set a container under the P-trap and disconnect the drains. Then get rid of the sink strainer. Get rid of any excess putty.</p>
<p>The Last Jeopardy answer, you ask? The device that controls water flow in your toilet. You'll see a supply line that runs from the outlet in the wall to the bottom of the toilet fill valve if you look behind your toilet. This is how water enters your toilet. After you flush the toilet, the fill valve opens to fill up the water in the toilet and the tank bowl, preparing the system for the next flush. If your fill valve is broken, not set at the correct level, or isn't set up properly, you may experience a regularly or constantly "running" toilet - which can cost you numerous dollars in squandered water.</p>
