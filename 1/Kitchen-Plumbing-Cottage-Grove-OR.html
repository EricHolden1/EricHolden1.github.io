Our comprehensive water quality program operates 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, to make sure that the water provided to our consumers is kept free from harmful impurities.

This can occur through a process known as backflow.</p>

<p>The Plumbing and Gasfitting Board advises the Director of the Department of Permits, Approvals and Inspections regarding the administration of Article 21, Title 15 of the Baltimore County Code, including licensing. Backsiphonage happens when there is an unfavorable pressure in the water distribution system, which draws the water from a personal water supply into the general public water system. This can take place at any time, such as throughout a water main break or during a big firefighting effort.</p>
<p>5. Put hot water down your drain after using the garbage disposal - In order to get rid of extraneous grease that can clog your kitchen sink, wash your drain with a bit of hot water.
