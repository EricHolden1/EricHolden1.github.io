<h3>Benefits Of Commercial Plumbing Services Bladensburg MD</h3>
<p>PEX pipes were thought to be a much better alternative to polybutylene and galvanized piping. Regrettably, one brand name is experiencing a lot of problems: Dura PEX. Dura PEX tends to have a great deal of oxidization. This triggers cracks in the tubing that can lead to leaks. As these leakages take place, zinc is seeped from the fittings on the pipes, causing them to deteriorate. Lastly, chlorinated water has actually been found to trigger cracks in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the best service to all of these issues.</p>
