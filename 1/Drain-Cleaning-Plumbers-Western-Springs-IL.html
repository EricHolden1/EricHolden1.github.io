Low Flow Toilets: While low circulation toilets are excellent at conserving you money on your water bills, some older models do not have the flushing power to properly eliminate waste, which results in accumulations.</p>
<p>Foul Sewer Smell: Among the very first most apparent signs of a sewer issue is a smell of sewage when you flush the toilet, or in the yard (in the area where your sewer line would be). This can be a basic issue such as a broken water seal, or it can suggest a larger problem such as a broken sewer pipe. Drain repairs can prevent major damage to your house.
