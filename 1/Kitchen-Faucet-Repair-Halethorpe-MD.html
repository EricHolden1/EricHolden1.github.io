<p>A number of organizations, such as the American Water Functions Association (AWWA) and the American Backflow Prevention Association (ABPA) use certification courses designed to train experts to check backflow preventers. Requirements for training vary by jurisdiction. Inspection of backflow preventers requires understanding of installation requirements, although inspectors are not required to end up being certified.</p>
<p>Next comes the metal mount ring and rubber cushion mount (or cushion ring). Their right orientation will be labeled. When properly fitted together hold the mount ring and disposal in location, these two pieces have complementary grooves that. Holding the mount ring at the upper part of the flange, work the cushion mount over the bottom of the flange, ensuring that the rubber of the cushion mount is fully and firmly locking into the groove on the bottom of the flange. When set up correctly, you must not be able to eliminate the cushion install without significant pulling and extending, and the mount ring needs to rotate easily around it.</p>
