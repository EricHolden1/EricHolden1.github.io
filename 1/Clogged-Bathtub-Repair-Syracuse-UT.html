<p>I had a major sewer issue with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was supporting into the basement shower. I began calling any number I could discover on Google. I in fact got their number for another company that couldn't come quickly enough but referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to investigate and give me a price quote. They immediately cleared the preliminary blockage, enabling the renters to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon further investigation, there was a considerable blockage that needed excavation to investigate. His team was on website the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this preliminary problem and installing a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed.
