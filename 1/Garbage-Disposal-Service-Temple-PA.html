For example, Philadelphia's water district needs all residential systems supplying devoted sprinkler heads to have a connection from the lawn sprinkler to the toilet tank that's farthest from the supply of water. This removes the need for a backflow preventer, since whenever that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>
<p>Water softener systems work by getting rid of hardness minerals and changing them with salt ions. Water conditioners are devices that help prevent the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale.

Due to the fact that water conditioners use a physical media rather of a chemical media, they are in some cases thought about a greener option in areas where it is prohibited to use salt. Water conditioners do not effectively remove firmness from the water supply, however, as the only way to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>
