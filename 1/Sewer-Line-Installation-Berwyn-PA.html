<h3>Emergency Plumbing Tips For Your Everyday Plumber Berwyn PA</h3>

Today, most quality contractors use PEX or copper pipes.</p>
<p>Energy Efficiency. Choosing a tank with a minimum of 1.5 inches of foam insulation and an Energy Star ranking is advisable. The energy effectiveness of a storage hot water heater is suggested by its Energy Factor (EF). The more efficient the hot water heater the higher the EF ranking.
