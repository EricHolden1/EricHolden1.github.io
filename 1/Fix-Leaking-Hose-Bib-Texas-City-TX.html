<p>If you live in an older house with older pipes and such then you will begin to experience a clean out period. Depending upon water use, this can use up to 90 days. FutureSoft softener will really break down and the clean the inside of your pipes and heating components. As this takes place, you will experience an increase in identifying anywhere water vaporizes.
