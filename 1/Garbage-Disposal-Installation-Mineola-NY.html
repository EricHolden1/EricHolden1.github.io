<p>Backflow preventers are important for creating a safe water system system. No matter which model you choose, all water softeners need to be effectively kept. The brine solution need to be combined and saved in the salt water tank. Periodic blocking of the resin also needs unique attention. For instance, if the raw water supply is turbid it might clog the resin with mud and clay. Sometimes, regular backwashing with water will solve this problem. If not, gradually stir the resin during the backwash cycle to help separate the material. Similarly, germs and fungi also form mats in the resin that reduce its effectiveness. Decontaminating the water prior to softening or periodically cleaning the softener with chlorine bleach will eliminate these annoyances. Nevertheless, read the manufacturer's directions prior to including any chemicals to the unit.</p>
