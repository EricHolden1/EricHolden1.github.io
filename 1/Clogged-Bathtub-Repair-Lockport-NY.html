<p>Solar hot water heater: These ecologically friendly and cost-effective heaters draw energy from the sun to heat water. They require no electricity or gas and can reduce your expenses by an estimated 14 to 18%. A water heater installation is not the repair on which to sharpen your plumbing skills if you're fairly inexperienced. So save yourself some major trouble by being honest with yourself about where your experience level is.</p>
<p>The labor expenses for disposal installation are mainly time related. If everything is prepared, in great condition, and the disposal is on hand and easily put in, the plumber will likely just charge for an hour or two of time. If things need to be modified, replaced, or moved to accommodate the disposal, this will take longer, and will up the number of hours needed and therefore the overall expenses. A lot of plumbers charge between $45 and $65 per hour, with the majority of disposal installations running $50 per hour for 3 hours overall, making the labor expenses approximately $150.</p>
<p>Just recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line between their brand-new home and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we used our sewer camera to inspect the line and determine the reason for the issue. The line was plainly degrading; some areas were only held together by the ground around them. Another clog loomed. Even worse, the line could collapse requiring a major repair or replacement.</p>
