<p>After getting here after their window, they began to examine the kitchen sink (and after among the 2 gentlemen threw up outside), they ran a snake down the sink and after that put the sink back together but claimed they would not take responsibility if it leaked now because of some unspecified oddities in how my sink was assembled. After they provided me the "don't pour grease down the sink" lecture and they left, I discovered they managed to reassemble the sink in such a manner in which the sprayer hose was twisted around the plumbing. I didn't even bother to try calling them back, because I never wish to see this company once again.</p>
<p>The typical plumber's per hour wage is $68-$ 138. Often times basic repairs, such as unclogging a drain or a toilet, will have a repaired price of about $220 unless there are extenuating scenarios. The cost to snake a drain is from $3-$ 13. Some plumbers will charge a fee to take a look at your circumstance and inform you what needs to be done, however if you hire them, that charge will be subtracted from the bill. A plumber may charge $50-$ 100 to detect the issue and come. 2 Needing to call a plumber after hours, on the weekend, or on a vacation will cost more.</p>
