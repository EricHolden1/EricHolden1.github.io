<p>Gradually, the resin beads in the water softener will end up being covered with calcium and magnesium ions, lessening their capability to soften tough water. Through a process called regeneration, water is instantly flushed through the water softener with a concentrated amount of regenerant. Now the resin beads pick up the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the solidity on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems feature a whole house water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener goes back to service, providing the whole house with clean, soft water.</p>

If the cost of a repair is over half the cost of a replacement at that point, then it makes more monetary sense to replace your water heater.</p>
