<p>A. The toilet fill valve measurements we reveal are determined from the within bottom of the tank to the top of the fill valve. The threaded water supply shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not included in this measurement. The addition of a backflow preventer minimizes water service pressure to the building; additional, more considerable expenses can happen if the drop in water pressure becomes a concern for homeowners. If installing a pump or larger size water service and backflow prevention device would counteract the pressure loss, a PE or RA can help figure out.</p>
<p>At least when every three months, drain water from the tank. With time sediment constructs at the bottom of the heater, which can obstruct efficiency, and draining pipes a gallon or so assists remove the sediment.

To prevent even more, more-costly repairs (like water damage from burst pipes), you may want to consider repiping your whole home when you find a leak.</p>
