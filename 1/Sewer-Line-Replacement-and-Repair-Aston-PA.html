<p>In the typical repair, the old rubber parts should be gotten rid of and replaced with brand-new rubber parts. It is important that just initial factory repair parts are used when putting the backflow prevention assembly back together whether they are hardware or rubber parts.

An airplane garage will need a really different fire defense system than the system needed in an apartment. The backflow security requirements for these 2 examples would likewise vary significantly.</p>
