For example, in a four-tank MTS setup with responsive flow innovation, only one of the 4 tanks is needed to soften water when the carwash isn't busy. Nevertheless, more tanks come on-line as the wash bays fill. This responsive style allows the MTS to use up to 50% less salt and 38% less regeneration water than conventional single-tank or twin alternating systems.</p>
