<h3>Plumber Installation & Repair Service Hebron IN</h3>
<p>Water softeners leaks are mainly triggered because of an issue at the point of installation or because of maintenance. When installing the plumbing to your softener, take your time and guarantee your fittings are threaded well and your push-to-connect fittings are seated correctly. It can also cause the system to leak if the bypass valve is cracked. Bypass valves are fitted with -rings that may need to be re-lubricated or replaced in time. A cracked rotor valve or rotor valve seal may also be the perpetrator. The rotor valve directs the water throughout the system during softening and regeneration procedures. A used water valve can lock up and spring a leak. It is most likely broken and merely needs to be replaced if the rotor valve's seal is leaking.</p>
