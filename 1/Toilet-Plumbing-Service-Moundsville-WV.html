<p>Identifying if you need a water softener is a personal preference. A permit is not needed for repairs which include only the working parts of a faucet or valve or clearance of interruptions offered modifications are not made in the existing piping or components. A normal water softener consists of a tall, narrow water-softener tank, and a brief, broad brine tank. The softener tank is connected to the home's water-supply line.
