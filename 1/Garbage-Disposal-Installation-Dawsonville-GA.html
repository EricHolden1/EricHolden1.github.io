<h3>Drain Cleaning Techniques in Dawsonville GA</h3>

The typical cost to install a gas line for a kitchen stove is $15 to $25 per linear foot. Overall costs range from $200 to $1,000 or more depending on the length of piping needed to link to the main gas supply, which typically averages 30'.</p>
<p>If you're purchasing a brand-new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large majority of toilets, the waste pipe is focused about 12 in. from the wall. However with a few models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, just measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in.. The majority of house centers carry just one or two 10-in. designs and no 14-in. designs. Be prepared to invest much more if you have to special-order a toilet. If there's a door near the toilet, also measure how far the bowl protrudes from the wall. If you are changing a toilet with a standard bowl with an extended" model, the door may not close. Keep reading to learn how to install a toilet.</p>
<p>All of the drains in your house, from your toilets, sinks, tubs, and showers all drain into one main drain under your house then exit into the sewer or septic tank from your home. When you experience clogs in numerous drains simultaneously in your house, then that generally means that your main sewer line is supporting. This can take place in multiple locations and any combination of drains. For example, water may fill in your bathtub when you run your washing machine. There are a number of mixes of this kind of backup. The point is your drains all connect, and when you have a backup in your main sewer line, you'll experience backup and overflowing from numerous drain lines in your house.</p>
