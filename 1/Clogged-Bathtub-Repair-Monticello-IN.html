Again, years of experience and extensive testing led us to create a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other design on the marketplace. Fluidization is the crucial to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the firmness in the water to calcite crystals which will not adhere to anything even under extreme temperature levels.
