You'll need to create a tight seal around the plunger, so fill the side of the sink you mean to plunge with sufficient water to cover the bell of the plunger. Place the plunger firmly over the drain and plunge strongly a number of times. Remove the plunger and flush the drain well with warm water when you hear the suction clear the clog.</p>
