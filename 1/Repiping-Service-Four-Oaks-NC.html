<p>Won't drain - The unit may not be slicing food effectively and waste might have clogged the drain pipe. Nevertheless, if there are several leaks within the system, or if there is proof of rust in a number of locations, it is most likely time to repipe. A water softener is packed with resin beads. Tough water with calcium and magnesium flows through this resin and, in a process called ion exchange, the hardness ions in the water trade locations with soft ions on the resin beads.

<p>Usually, it will cost from $45 to $197 to repair a toilet yourself or between $130 and $310 to have actually professional repairs done by a plumber.
