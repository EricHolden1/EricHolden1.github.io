<h3>Water Leak Detection Tips for Homes at Piedmont SC</h3>
<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to run, the control valve or valves must remain open and the system needs to be constantly kept an eye on. Therefore, there is a device on each control valve that either avoids the valve from being closed or sends out an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as basic as a locked chain through the control valve that avoids that valve from opening, or an alarm that notifies the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems make use of both techniques. NFPA 13 refers to all such devices as supervisory gadgets.</p>
