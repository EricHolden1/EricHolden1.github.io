Continuous gross smells originating from the toilet can show you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. You might need a brand-new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising properly. Bulges in the supply line can trigger a leak and burst. Tank lids can crack and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed if mishandled. While this will not impact the function of your toilet, it definitely doesn't do much for the visual of your bathroom.
