<p>In the meantime, however, we suggest you first try utilizing non-harsh and non-abrasive white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Merely put a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, add some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mixture sit for a while. If that doesn't work, you can try a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner. Much of these cleaners contain concentrated levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be extremely damaging if it is available in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs.
