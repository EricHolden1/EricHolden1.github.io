This can take place in multiple locations and any mix of drains. For example, water may fill up in your bathtub when you run your washing machine. There are several mixes of this kind of backup. The point is your drains all connect, and as soon as you have a backup in your main sewer line, you'll experience backup and overruning from several drain lines in your home.</p>
