<p>DCVs are particularly created to prevent backflow in fire sprinkler systems. The pillar for normal fire security applications, DCVs include an inlet (upstream) shutoff valve, two individually operating spring-loaded check valves (generally inside a single valve body), 4 test dicks, and an outlet (downstream) shutoff valve. Light-duty commercial-grade garbage disposals start around $500-$ 2,500 and go up depending on size, brand and features.</p>
