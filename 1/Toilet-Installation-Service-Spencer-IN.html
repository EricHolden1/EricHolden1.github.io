<h3>Sewer and Drain Cleaning Tips in Spencer IN</h3>

In 2010, for example, students at a Bowling Green, Kentucky grade school suffered nausea and other symptoms after a contractor dealing with the A/C system triggered the antifreeze chemical glycol to backflow into the school's drinking supply.</p>
<p>If you're buying a new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge bulk of toilets, the drain is focused about 12 in. from the wall. However with a few models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, simply measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in.. A lot of home centers carry just one or 2 10-in. models and no 14-in. designs. If you have to special-order a toilet, be prepared to spend much more. If there's a door near the toilet, likewise determine how far the bowl protrudes from the wall. If you are changing a toilet with a standard bowl with a lengthened" model, the door may not close. Read on to learn how to install a toilet.</p>

When the system passes our tests, it's great to go for you.</p>
