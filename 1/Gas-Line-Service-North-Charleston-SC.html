<p>2 designs of PVBs are readily available: (1) Pressure Vacuum Breaker and (2) Spill Resistant Vacuum Breaker. A PVB is a mechanical backflow prevention assembly that consists of an independently acting, spring-loaded check valve and an independently acting, spring-loaded, air inlet valve on the discharge side of the check valve. It includes shutoff valves at each end of the assembly and is geared up with test cocks. A PVB might be utilized to isolate health or non-health dangers but works versus back-siphonage only.</p>
<p>The system has actually returned to an absolutely no need condition (no valves open downstream). Nevertheless, debris between the # 1 Examine Valve seat and sealing disc, or damage in the components, is avoiding the # 1 Inspect from closing all the way. This allows pressure to adjust between the Supply Side and the Zone of Lowered Pressure. When this occurs, the Relief Valve Spring presses back versus the Relief Valve Diaphram, opening the Recreational Vehicle Discharge.</p>

Idea: Throw a towel on the floor underneath to catch water that will drain from the line.</p>
