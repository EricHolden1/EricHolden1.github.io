<p>When selecting the proper system security there are numerous factors to consider we need to look at. In my mind there is no one size fits all scenarios in the cross-connection world.

Fire security system are developed to match the threat that exists in the areas they are set up in. As structure types and contents of these structures can be extremely different, we need to understand that the fire protection system for any installation requires to be developed and installed to meet that specific hazard or need.
