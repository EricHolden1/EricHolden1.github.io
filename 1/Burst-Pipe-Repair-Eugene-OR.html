<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is only half the formula! To just put some media inside a tank and hope for the best is common in our industry and numerous companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Again, years of experience and thorough testing led us to develop a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other style on the marketplace. Fluidization is the crucial to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the hardness in the water to calcite crystals which will not stick to anything even under severe temperature levels. It's only with the media and the fluidization properly working together that you can accomplish this.</p>
