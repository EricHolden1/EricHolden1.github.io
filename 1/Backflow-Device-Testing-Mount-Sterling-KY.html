It prevails for a toilet to have actually worn out parts eventually which triggers the toilet to run. When someone states a toilet is running, what they imply is the toilet will not stop running.

We will generally suggest our PowerSnake or ZOOM Jetting ® services, depending on the severity of the situation.
