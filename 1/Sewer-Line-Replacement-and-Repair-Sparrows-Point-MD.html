A plan may be necessary to get the permit if new work is performed such as replacement of gas piping.</p>
<p>Ultraviolet disinfection systems utilize UV light to destroy micro-organisms and offer purified water.

If you spot a leak and select a patching task rather of a repiping task, just remember that all the pipes in your house are most likely made from the same material and they may be next.
