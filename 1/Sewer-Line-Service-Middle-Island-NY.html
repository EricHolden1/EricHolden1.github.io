PEX pipes are understood to be more heat resistant than other kinds of piping. They are considered safe and are regularly used to carry drinking water in brand-new building and constructions.</p>

<p>Chelation: Another approach is to introduce a chemical substance that acts as a chelating agent. Magnesium and calcium bind to this chelating representative and stay suspended in the water instead of developing on surface areas.
