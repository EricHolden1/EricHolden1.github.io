<p>Examples of backflow conditions consist of backsiphonage and back pressure. Early diagnosis and repair can save your plumbing system from unneeded clogs even more down the water lines. In some instances, resins can not be washed of impurities and will need to be replaced. (This need to not hold true if the resin is periodically restored and maintained.) Consult your water softener dealership for info on resin replacement.</p>
<p>The simplest mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a moveable disc attached to a climatic vent. In case of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop below that of the outside air. This triggers the disc to open, allowing air to bring back and go into the valve pressure comparable to ambient climatic standard. This remediation of pressure breaks the siphon and prevents cross contamination.</p>
