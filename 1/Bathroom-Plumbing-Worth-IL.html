Current changes to the Safe Drinking Water Act mandated that all commercial plumbing fixtures, valves, pipes, and fittings that are straight intended for human water consumption are required to be manufactured with less than 0.25 percent leaded brass material. Zurn Wilkins plumbing products that fall within this category have been designated lead-free," meaning they are certified.</p>
<p>The most basic mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a moveable disc connected to an atmospheric vent. In case of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop listed below that of the outside air. This triggers the disc to open, enabling air to go into the valve and bring back pressure comparable to ambient climatic standard. This remediation of pressure breaks the siphon and avoids cross contamination.</p>
