<p>I had a significant sewer issue with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was supporting into the basement shower. I started calling any number I might discover on Google. I in fact got their number for another company that couldn't come soon enough but referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to investigate and offer me a price quote. They right away cleared the initial clog, permitting the renters to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon more examination, there was a significant obstruction that needed excavation to investigate. His group was on site the extremely next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this initial concern and setting up a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This took place yet a 3rd time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
