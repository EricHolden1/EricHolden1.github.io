<p>A number of organizations, such as the American Water Works Association (AWWA) and the American Backflow Prevention Association (ABPA) use certification courses designed to train experts to evaluate backflow preventers. Requirements for training differ by jurisdiction. Inspection of backflow preventers requires knowledge of installation requirements, although inspectors are not needed to end up being certified.</p>
<p>A waste disposal unit can minimize a house's overall garbage output by crushing most typical food scraps so they can be removed through the sink as wastewater.
