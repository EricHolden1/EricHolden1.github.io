<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to operate, the control valve or valves must remain open and the system needs to be constantly kept track of. For that reason, there is a device on each control valve that either prevents the valve from being closed or sends out an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as easy as a locked chain through the control valve that prevents that valve from opening, or an alarm system that notifies the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems use both techniques. NFPA 13 refers to all such gadgets as supervisory devices.</p>
