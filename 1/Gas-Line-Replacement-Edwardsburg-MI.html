<p>Backflow threatens because it can pollute the public drinking supply with contaminants like fertilizers, pesticides, human waste, and harmful chemicals.

<p>Then attach the waste pipe (and dishwasher hose, if appropriate). If your unit is outlet-ready-- pay attention to this part-- make sure your disposal switch remains in the off" position prior to you plug the brand-new system in. While it's not likely that having a disposal start up while your head is pressed against it will cause decapitation, it may terrify a number of years off your life.
