<p>Hard water is softened by removing the calcium and magnesium it consists of. When hard water travels through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (solidity) ions are removed through an ion exchange procedure, so just softened water goes through to your house.

Salt is normally utilized in the regrowth procedure and brings back the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange procedure can begin again.</p>
