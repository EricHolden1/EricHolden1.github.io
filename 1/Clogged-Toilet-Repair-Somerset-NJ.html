<p>Insert the flange on the top side of the sink, and attach the attachment system on the underside (Image 1). It is helpful to apply pressure on the flange from above utilizing a second set of hands or a heavy item. This will keep the flange in place while connecting the attaching system listed below. Ensure the plumber's putty is visibly exuding beyond the edge of the flange all around (Image 2). Remove the excess putty with a rag once a total seal has actually formed.</p>
<p>At this point, the professional crew makes sure everything is running correctly. Your plumbing system is tested for stability, and all connections are checked. A professional site inspection is important to an effective repipe. Once the plumbing system is checked and okayed, its time to tidy up the mess. Its time to patch the holes in the wall and repaint.
