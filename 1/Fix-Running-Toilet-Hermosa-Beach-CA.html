Salt ions are held loosely and are replaced easily by calcium and magnesium ions. Throughout this procedure, complimentary" sodium ions are released into the water. The time in between recharging cycles depends on the solidity of the water, the quantity of water utilized, the size of the unit and the capacity of the exchange media to eliminate solidity.</p>
