Blanc also developed a much bigger variation of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal. It had to be pulled by a truck and included a 10 hp gas engine and 1000 feet of steel cable television. It was capable of cleaning big commercial and community sewer pipes. An enhanced variation called "The Mainliner" was introduced in 1958 that could likewise thread telephone cable. It was ceased in 1973.</p>
