<p>Metal alloys are prone to an electro-chemical condition called corrosion. Rust can literally eat a metal away causing the metal to not be as strong as it initially was or modify the tolerances triggering parts to not work in a backflow preventer. If the part is usable or should be changed, the effect of corrosion on a metal alloy should be evaluated to determine.</p>
<p>Pre-action sprinkler systems generally are installed in areas where water could trigger disastrous damage, such as in freezers, computer rooms, and locations with electronic equipment. The piping in a pre-action system includes air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is kept back by the pre-action valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire happens, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then allows water into the system's piping. The water is released through the open sprinkler.</p>
