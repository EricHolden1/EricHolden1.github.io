<p>Everyday usage should not cause a water softener to leak. Leakages can likewise happen if you run into the softener and jostle it, pulling the fitting apart. To prevent this from happening, install the system in a safe and stable  area. If you reside in an earthquake-prone area of the country, protect the softener so that if the foundation begins moving, the softener does not tip over and rip out the plumbing. You need to wait until after the cycle is completed and then checked the system for fractures or broken fittings if your water softener is leaking during regeneration. You must also inspect to make certain your drain line is never ever blocked up with particles. A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener throughout regeneration and flood your basement or garage.</p>
