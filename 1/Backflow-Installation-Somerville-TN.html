A garbage disposal typically plugs into a 120-volt GFCI (ground-fault circuit interruptor) outlet under the sink.

To just pour some media inside a tank and hope for the very best is typical in our market and numerous companies try to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system.

Fluidization is the essential to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media transforms the solidity in the water to calcite crystals which will not adhere to anything even under extreme temperatures. It's only with the media and the fluidization correctly interacting that you can achieve this.</p>
