<p>Backflow means the unfavorable turnaround of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the potable supply of water; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from happening. Points at which a potable water system connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, however they must be carefully developed and set up to avoid backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>
<p>When the data gathered from the field test suggests the assembly has actually broken down in its performance listed below the developed minimum standard, backflow preventers should just be fixed. The test treatment is a diagnostic evaluation of the functions of a backflow preventer. When the backflow preventer fails to fulfill this minimum standard, the backflow preventer need to be repaired or if needed, changed. These minimum requirements are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly starts to weaken in its efficiency, it can still prevent backflow. The purpose of a repair is to return the assembly back to its initial factory working specifications. This means the assembly is fixed so that it can carry out above the minimum standard.</p>
