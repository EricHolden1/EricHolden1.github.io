<p>In 1939, after his Roto-Rooter sewer cleaning machine showed effective, Sam Blanc developed and built a smaller sized design that ran on the very same principle but could clean and clear bathroom and kitchen sink drains as well as laundry drains and other household plumbing drains. Blanc also built a much bigger variation of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal. It had to be hauled by a truck and included a 10 hp fuel engine and 1000 feet of steel cable. It can cleaning large commercial and municipal sewer pipes. An enhanced variation called "The Mainliner" was presented in 1958 that could also thread telephone cable. It was discontinued in 1973.</p>
<p>Softeners generally remove calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+) ions. Calcium and magnesium are typically described as 'hardness minerals'. In addition, if your pipes are rattling, clanging, clacking and making more noise than they need to be (more than water streaming through the pipes), that's a big warning that something more serious is wrong with them.</p>

Pointer: Toss a towel on the floor below to capture water that will drain from the line.</p>
