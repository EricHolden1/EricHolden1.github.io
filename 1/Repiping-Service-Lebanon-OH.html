This can require the drinkable water to reverse its direction of flow through the cross-connection in between the two systems. Prospective pollutants can then get in the drinkable water system. The best way to decrease accumulation is have a professional flush it a minimum of as soon as a year. In some areas of Virginia, where the water is particularly hard with high mineral content, you may need to flush the water heater more frequently.</p>
<p>Single flush High Effectiveness Toilets (HETs) use 1.28 gallons per flush. The most recent dual flush HET provided by Bonney will use approximately 1.1 gallons per flush.
