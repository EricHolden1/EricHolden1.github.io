When you have cast iron drain lines you need 3-5 gallons of water that an older toilet offers to push the waste out of your drain system. Existing guidelines limit the quantity of water a toilet can use per flush to 1.28 gallons per flush which can leave debris piling up in cast iron drain lines. We offer two types of water treatment systems for difficult water: Advantage Series Salt Water Softeners and NaturSoft ® Water Softener Alternatives.</p>

A plumber can quickly replace these parts.</p>
