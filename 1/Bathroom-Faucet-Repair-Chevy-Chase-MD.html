When you have cast iron drain lines you need 3-5 gallons of water that an older toilet offers to push the waste out of your drain system. Existing guidelines limit the quantity of water a toilet can use per flush to 1.28 gallons per flush which can leave debris piling up in cast iron drain lines. We offer two types of water treatment systems for difficult water: Advantage Series Salt Water Softeners and NaturSoft Â® Water Softener Alternatives.</p>
<p>Understand that softened water includes trace quantities of salt. An 8-ounce glass of water includes about the same amount of salt as a piece of bread.

If this does not work, you might need to replace among your toilet's components, typically the flapper. There might likewise be a concern with the chain attached to the float or the flapper ball. A plumber can quickly replace these parts.</p>
