Like any home appliance, a toilet tank includes lots of little moving parts that might need replaced with use over time. Flapper valves, fill valves, and other tank parts can all wear and trigger toilet leakages that aren't plainly visible to the naked eye.

When chemicals are added to a fire defense system supplied by a drinkable water supply, increased defense is also required.

Hanging on a pipeline might trigger it to come loose or break, releasing gas into the home. The outdoor gas meter need to be kept clear of any debris, such as plants or snow, so it is easily accessible in an emergency.</p>
