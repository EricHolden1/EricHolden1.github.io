<p>A partial reroute is basically a little scale repiping of several affected locations of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost effective, it is possible to only desert the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, walls and ceilings. Costing less than a complete repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can accumulate in cost extremely quickly. This is the main reason why we will advise a full repipe in particular neighborhoods, based upon our experience.</p>

Through a procedure called regrowth, water is instantly flushed through the water softener with a focused amount of regenerant. Now the resin beads get the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the hardness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems feature a whole house water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener goes back to service, providing the whole home with clean, soft water.</p>
