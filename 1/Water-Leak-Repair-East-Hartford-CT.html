<h3>Choosing A Good Plumber East Hartford CT</h3>
<p>Usually, it will cost from $45 to $197 to repair a toilet yourself or in between $130 and $310 to have professional repairs done by a plumber. The per hour charge for a plumbing contractor is $72 to $82, which does not consist of parts or products. Prices depend on the specific repair required, where you live, hiring a plumber vs. hiring a handyman, and whether you can DIY it.</p>
<p>You have galvanized iron pipes. I had Rate Busters replace a hot water heater tank and a main water shut down valve. They were timely and very responsive to send me a bid which was extremely competitive. They were extremely professional and did an amazing task. I would definitely call them once again for my plumbing needs. Now, if this discoloration only appears when hot water is being used, then the rust probably exists within your water heater tank and not in your pipes. This is of course still a problem that needs to be dealt with right now (you'll likely need a new water heater) but not one that needs repiping.</p>
