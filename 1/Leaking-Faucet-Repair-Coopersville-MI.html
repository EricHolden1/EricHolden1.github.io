<p>In some cases you know you have a sewer line break because you can smell nasty smells or you have a sewage back-up in your home. It is very important to identify the exact location of the break in your sewer line. Many times the break can be on the city side of the sewer line and knowing this can conserve you countless dollars in repairs. Merely sharing a copy of your sewer line video with the city inspector can solve the problem. The professionals and plumbers at Jim Dandy Sewer and Plumbing can make a copy of your sewer scope video on a thumb drive so that you constantly have a copy for your insurance company, realtor or city inspector.</p>
<p>Single flush High Performance Toilets (HETs) use 1.28 gallons per flush. The latest dual flush HET provided by Bonney will use an average of 1.1 gallons per flush. This is where we disagree with InSinkErator. We suggest, as many plumbers do, to use disposals sparingly. Appropriate care and garbage disposal maintenance will keep it running long past its warranty and keep your drain lines clear.</p>
