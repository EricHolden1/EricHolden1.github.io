<p>You have galvanized iron pipes. I had Cost Busters replace a water heater tank and a main water shut down valve. They were extremely responsive and prompt to send me a bid which was extremely competitive. They were very professional and did an awesome task. I would certainly call them again for my plumbing requires. Now, if this discoloration only appears when warm water is being utilized, then the rust probably exists within your hot water heater tank and not in your pipes. This is of course still an issue that requires to be handled immediately (you'll likely need a new water heater) however not one that needs repiping.</p>
