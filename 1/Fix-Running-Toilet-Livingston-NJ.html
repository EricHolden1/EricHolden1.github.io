If you live in an earthquake-prone area of the country, protect the softener so that if the foundation begins moving, the softener does not tip over and remove the plumbing. If your water softener is leaking throughout regeneration, you need to wait up until after the cycle is completed and after that examined the system for fractures or broken fittings. You must likewise examine to make certain your drain line is never blocked up with debris. A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener throughout regrowth and flood your basement or garage.</p>
