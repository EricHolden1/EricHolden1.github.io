When you have actually cast iron drain lines you need 3-5 gallons of water that an older toilet supplies to press the waste out of your drain system. Present regulations restrict the quantity of water a toilet can utilize per flush to 1.28 gallons per flush which can leave particles piling up in cast iron drain lines. We offer two types of water treatment systems for hard water: Benefit Series Salt Water Softeners and NaturSoft Â® Water Softener Alternatives.</p>
<p>Pretty little flappers might get all the magnificence in the toilet world, but the trip lever is the bridge between man and machine. After all, if the journey lever doesn't lift the flapper to flush the toilet, you have to wiggle and jerk and in some cases even stick your hand in there and raise the flapper by hand. And who wishes to do all that work??? In all severity though, ensuring your trip lever is working well can save you the trouble of those small daily inconveniences - that the majority of people simply deal with and never realize they can fix in about 5 minutes - not to point out the gallons of water lost every day by a poor seal.</p>
