No matter what type of hot water heater you have or are interested in, the experts at Timothy Off can assist. Contact us today for our hot water heater installation services. For instance, if your kitchen sink is backed up due to the fact that you flushed potato peels down the disposal, a quick drain snaking can separate the blockage and send it down the pipes.

<p>This is a totally valid question that we hear a lot. The disposal unit is not, obviously, as essential as your water heater, water line, or drainpipes. However, it adds a fair amount of performance to the kitchen. A garbage disposal is a relatively little round device installed under the kitchen drain. When turned on, your disposal system takes down wastewater and any material debris by centrifugal force. However it does not shred such particles. Instead, it grinds it into a paste at high speed so that it can quickly stream into the drain pipe together with the rest of your wastewater.</p>
<p>If you 'd like to eliminate the salt, simply fill the salt water tank with potassium chloride pellets, not salt pellets. The only issue is that potassium chloride is costly: $25 to $30 per 50-pound bag. Salt costs $4 to $6 per bag.

A lot of high-pressure water jetters will operate with up to 4,000 PSI of pressure and will push anywhere from 2-18 gallons of water per minute through a pipe.</p>
