<p>As the name recommends, a backflow preventer works to ensure that liquids do not recede against the required direction of flow. When utilized in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is utilized to ensure that water does not stream from the sprinkler system back into the municipal water system, or other source of drinking water. Regrettably, water kept in the lawn sprinkler can become infected. If allowed to return to the water supply, there is potential for the infected water to end up being a health hazard. The backflow preventer is meant to prevent water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be examined regularly for effectiveness, along with checked yearly by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
