<p>When your hot water heater starts to leak, you need to replace it quick. We'll show you how to install your own gas hot water heater in less than a day. Even if you do not need a brand-new water heater right now, opportunities are you will within the next few years. Water heaters tend to last seven to 15 years. If yours is getting old, this short article is also for you. If you're helpful with fundamental tools and have a bit of experience soldering copper, changing a water heater isn't difficult.</p>
<p>The simplest method to keep you and your family safe from the potential risks of backflow through cross connections is to not create cross connections in the first place. Nevertheless, if you do have a cross connection to a lawn sprinkler system, boiler, swimming pool, water function or other type of cross connection, have an authorized backflow prevention assembly set up.</p>

Our technicians carefully examine your entire drainage system with video camera pipe inspection to prevent future problems before they take place.
