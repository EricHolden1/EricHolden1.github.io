<p>Backsiphonage can take place when there is a sudden decrease in the water pressure of the circulation system, such as during fire battling or when a water main breaks. At these occurances, water flow can be reversed. This turnaround can produce a suction result and draw prospective impurities into the potable (drinking) water system. Tank water heaters are typically found in a lot of houses. Their parts are an insulated tank, generally holding 30-50 gallons of water, to heat and shop the water up until it's needed. A pipe emerges from the top to deliver hot water to its destination, kitchen, bathroom, or other sinks.</p>
<p>Recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line between their brand-new home and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we used our sewer camera to examine the line and identify the cause of the issue. The line was plainly degrading; some sections were only held together by the ground around them. Another clog loomed. Even worse, the line could collapse requiring a significant repair or replacement.</p>
