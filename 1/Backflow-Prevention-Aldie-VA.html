<p>Wood pipes were utilized in London and somewhere else throughout the 16th and 17th centuries. The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a little hole in which the water would go through. 21 The multiple pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wooden pipes were used in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wooden tubes were widely used in the USA during the 20th century. These pipes (used in location of corrugated iron or reinforced concrete pipes) were made from areas cut from brief lengths of wood. Locking of adjacent rings with wood dowel pins produced a flexible structure. About 100,000 feet of these wooden pipes were installed during WW2 in drainage culverts, storm sewage systems and avenues, under highways and at army camps, naval stations, airfields and ordnance plants.</p>

Your hot water heater must be flushed once a year. If you have a 15âyearâold hot water heater that's never been flushed, it may have up to 8 inches of sediment at the bottom of the tank. That suggests eight fewer inches of warm water, not to point out the truth that your faucet water is being heated up in a tank with calcium, scale, rust, dirt, iron, and sulfuricâsmelling germs.</p>
