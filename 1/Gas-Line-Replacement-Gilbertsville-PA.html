<p>After getting here after their window, they started to investigate the kitchen sink (and after among the 2 gentlemen tossed up outdoors), they ran a snake down the sink and after that put the sink back together but claimed they wouldn't take duty if it leaked now because of some unspecified quirks in how my sink was assembled. After they provided me the "don't pour grease down the sink" lecture and they left, I saw they managed to reassemble the sink in such a way that the sprayer hose was wrapped around the plumbing. I didn't even bother to try calling them back, considering that I never wish to see this company again.</p>
