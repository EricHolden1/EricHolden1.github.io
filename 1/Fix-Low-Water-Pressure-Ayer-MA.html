<p>Woodbury, together with many other communities and organizations, has discovered the best way to prevent these stains from happening is by lowering the variety of times your water softener regrows. "Regrowing" describes the way softeners clean all the calcium and magnesium mineral deposits out of the filter medium when it ends up being "exhausted" or full. However, many water softeners restore too often, when the filter medium truly isn't complete. This can be fixed by just resetting your water softener to get rid of less solidity or to run longer in between regeneration cycles.</p>
