After we have actually cleaned up the body, and the repaired parts are still out of the body, and we have completed all of our part replacement and cleaning, we must open the inlet turned off to flush any rust or particles.

It is important that the inlet valve be opened to flush this dirt and particles even if some sort of water collection system has to be utilized to assure the line is correctly flushed.</p>
