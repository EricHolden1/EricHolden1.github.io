<p>The next step we must perform in the repair procedure, is to flush the incoming water line. After we have cleaned the body, and the repaired elements are still out of the body, and we have completed all of our part replacement and cleaning, we must open the inlet turned off to flush any rust or debris. This can be challenging, specifically when the backflow prevention assembly is set up inside an area where water can not be splashed around. It is necessary that the inlet valve be opened to flush this dirt and particles even if some sort of water collection system has to be used to guarantee the line is correctly flushed.</p>

Job well done: You don't want to wind up with gunk and water all over your kitchen floor. Leaving the task to a certified plumber makes sure a smooth installation procedure.</p>

In some areas of Virginia, where the water is specifically difficult with high mineral content, you might need to flush the hot water heater regularly.</p>
