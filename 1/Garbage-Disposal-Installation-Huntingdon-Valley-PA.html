<p>Sewer backups can be reported to (503) 823-1700. A reaction crew is readily available for initial investigation of sewer emergencies every day of the year. Call the City's sewer and drainage maintenance personnel at (503) 823-1700 if sewage from the City-maintained part of the sewer system backs up through toilets or sinks. City workers will inspect and get rid of obstructions in the mainline sewer and the portion of the service line that the City is accountable for.

<p>The EcoWater ESS1152 Series are non-resin based systems that can be tailored to your water needs. Your EcoWater Pro will evaluate your water to determine the ideal water treatment for your house. Since the softener's salt water tank nests inside of the salt tank, a single tank or cabinet-style system requires less area.

<p>There are two types of materials utilized to construct a waste disposal unit system: aluminum and stainless-steel. The typical cost of an aluminum waste disposal unit ranges from $60 to $150, while a stainless-steel garbage disposal has an average cost of just over $150. Sewer pipes can be infamously hard to trace, particularly on older properties, so you'll wish to employ someone who will trace the issue at its origin.</p>
