In my mind there is nobody size fits all situations in the cross-connection world. Each and every installation must be looked at on a specific basis as a special stand-alone system. The National Fire Security Association NFPA 13 Standard for the installation of lawn sprinkler contains the requirement for the sprinkler systems themselves. Fire security system are created to match the danger that exists in the places they are installed in. As building types and contents of these structures can be very various, we need to understand that the fire security system for any installation requires to be designed and set up to satisfy that specific danger or need. An airplane garage will need a very different fire security system than the system required in an apartment. The backflow defense requirements for these two examples would also vary greatly.</p>
