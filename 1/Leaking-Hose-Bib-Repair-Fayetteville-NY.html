<h3>How to Clear Clogged Drains Without Calling a Plumber in Fayetteville NY</h3>
<p>A clogged drain is another typical repair - primarily with sinks. Most of the times, a sink drain problem is triggered by excessive impurities or debris inside the drain like hair, grease, hair care products or soaps. While there are a number of chemical drain cleaning alternatives, in some cases this can cause more damage than assistance. Anytime you discover a clogged drain, connect to Resurrection Plumbing to identify the issue and suggest the best repairs.</p>
<p>If you're buying a new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge bulk of toilets, the drain is centered about 12 in. from the wall. But with a couple of models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, simply determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. Most home centers carry just one or 2 10-in. designs and no 14-in. models. Be prepared to spend much more if you have to special-order a toilet. If there's a door near the toilet, also measure how far the bowl extends from the wall. If you are replacing a toilet with a basic bowl with an extended" model, the door might not close. Read on to find out how to install a toilet.</p>

The primary types of mechanical backflow preventer are the reduced-pressure concept assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the double check valve assembly. A secondary type of mechanical backflow preventer is the residential double check valve.</p>
