<p>Whenever you flush your toilet, you'll see that water goes to fill up the bowl. However, in a properly working toilet, the water needs to stop running once the bowl is filled to its suitable capacity. If your toilet continues to run, chances are you have an internal leak and water is being discarded down the overflow. These leakages are very wasteful, as more than a hundred gallons of water end up taking a trip through the overflow.</p>
<p>When a flush valve triggers a toilet to run, a used flapper is usually the culprit. However not constantly. Initially, take a look at the chain that raises the flapper. If there's too much slack in the chain, it can tangle up and prevent the flapper from closing securely. A chain with insufficient slack can trigger problem too. Photo 3 shows how to set the slack just right.</p>
