<p>So, how does a softener know when to come down to business? The timing of regeneration depends on the type of softener you have. Softeners with a timer flush and recharge on the basis of a predetermined schedule-- state, 11 p.m. every three days, no matter whether the water in fact needs it. When needed, more recent units use digital sensors that keep an eye on bead depletion and other key metrics based on your water usage and for that reason just regrow. These newer systems, also referred to as demand-initiated regrowth softeners, are perfect since they conserve energy and cash-- utilizing less water and salt for regeneration.</p>
<p>The Final Jeopardy response, you ask? The device that regulates water flow in your toilet. You'll see a supply line that runs from the outlet in the wall to the bottom of the toilet fill valve if you look behind your toilet. This is how water gets into your toilet. After you flush the toilet, the fill valve opens to fill up the water in the toilet and the tank bowl, readying the system for the next flush. If your fill valve is broken, not set at the proper level, or isn't installed properly, you might experience a frequently or continuously "running" toilet - which can cost you numerous dollars in lost water.</p>
