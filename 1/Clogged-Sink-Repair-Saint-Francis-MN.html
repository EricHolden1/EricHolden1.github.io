<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health risk for individuals on low salt diet plans. Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to lower its mineral content. Generally, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending upon how hard the water was to start with. More difficult water will lead to more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this boost in salt is minor, however if you have actually been advised by a physician to follow a rigorous low sodium diet this boost can present problems.</p>
