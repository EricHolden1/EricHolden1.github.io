When roots eventually do piece your drain lines, they can cause clogs, breaks, and back-ups which may result in substantial home damage.

<p>Really typically the circular blade within is stuck. DO NOT REACH INSIDE TO FREE IT! Simply place a long, strong, wooden handle (a broom manage will be sufficient) into the opening. Let it rest versus the inside wall, and with force pushing down, rotate clockwise up until you feel it turn freely. It may be needed to reset the disposal. Locate the reset switch on the bottom of the system if so. Use any type of drain cleaner to free it if the clog persists.</p>
