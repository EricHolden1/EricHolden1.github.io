<p>Even if you think you can manage it by yourself, you most likely do not have a camera appropriate for identifying the cause of blockage around bends in your pipes. You may even have a drain snake convenient, however when's the last time you used it-- and are you sure you're doing it right?

Cleaners need to be used according to producer instructions to prevent contamination.</p>
