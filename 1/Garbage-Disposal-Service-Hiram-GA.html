<p>As the name recommends, a backflow preventer works to ensure that liquids do not recede against the needed instructions of circulation. When used in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is used to make sure that water does not stream from the sprinkler system back into the municipal supply of water, or other source of drinking water. Unfortunately, water held in the sprinkler system can become polluted. There is potential for the contaminated water to become a health danger if allowed to return to the water supply.
