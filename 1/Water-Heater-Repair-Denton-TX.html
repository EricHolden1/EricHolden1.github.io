<p>New homes constructed with copper pipes are particularly vulnerable to corrosive water conditions due to the fact that the copper pipes have not had a possibility to become covered inside. As advised by the MDH, it is best NOT to soften the water in a brand-new home for a period of three to 5 months after tenancy. This can be done by just bypassing the water softener's filter medium. See your owner's handbook for instructions on bypassing your softener. Many brand-new houses are constructed with PEX and not copper.</p>
