<p>Will sears install my garbage disposal for me. If your hot water heater is leaking, shut the unit down, and drain it if possible. Water leakages can cause substantial damage to walls, furnishings, and carpeting if left unaddressed. A leaking water heater can't be ignored, and you may wish to call us for emergency service to decrease the damage.

<p>You want to conserve water. Older toilets use up to 7 gallons of water per flush and are much less water-efficient than more recent designs. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's WaterSense toilets use less than 1.6 gallons per flush. Changing your toilet with a new model can save thousands of gallons of water - minimizing your utility bills and assisting the environment.</p>

<p>Sometimes, our technicians will advise that you replace your water heater instead of buy repairs. This is generally When the water heater is more than 10 years old or the cost of repairs would total more than half the cost of a whole brand-new unit, the case. In some cases a troublesome toilet simply requires a minor adjustment and life is back to regular. That is why we provide a 4-point toilet tune-up, where we (1) adjust the flush, (2) clean the seals, (3) replace the flapper and (4) perform a dye test.</p>
<p>For shallow pipes without any close-by utilities or blockages, digging through and replacing the pipe manually would likely be more affordable than relining it internally. However, if your damaged pipe runs under your driveway, any large trees or pathways, dig-free pipe lining might save you as much as $10,000 in repair costs, if not more.
