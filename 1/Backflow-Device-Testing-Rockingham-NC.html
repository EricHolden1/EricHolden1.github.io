Slip the mounting ring onto the flange then move on the breeze ring up until it snaps into location. Equally tighten up the three installing bolts, sealing the flange firmly against the sink. Eliminate excess plumber's putty.</p>
<p>Professional installers utilize internal pipe coating to repair an existing sewer pipe that has actually started to leak into surrounding soil.

While some older houses may not have backflow preventers, all newer homes are needed to have them.
