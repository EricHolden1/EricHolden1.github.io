<p>PEX pipes were thought to be a better option to polybutylene and galvanized piping. Unfortunately, one brand name is experiencing a great deal of problems: Dura PEX. Dura PEX tends to have a lot of oxidization. This triggers fractures in the tubing that can lead to leaks. As these leaks occur, zinc is seeped from the fittings on the pipes, causing them to weaken. Finally, chlorinated water has actually been discovered to trigger cracks in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the very best service to all of these problems.</p>
