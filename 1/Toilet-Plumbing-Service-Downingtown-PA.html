<p>A lot of residential houses have roof gutters that stream into downspout drains that direct water far from the house. When those downspouts are connected to underground drains that flow to community storm drains or street seamless gutters, they in some cases become clogged with tree roots and particles. These kinds of blockages trigger seamless gutters to overflow and the weight of the water can trigger seamless gutters to pull away from a home while inflicting water damage and rot to the structure. Please note that Roto-Rooter does unclean roof gutters or rectangular aluminum gutter downspouts.</p>
