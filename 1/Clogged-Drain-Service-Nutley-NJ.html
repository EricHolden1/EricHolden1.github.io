The technicians and plumbers at Jim Dandy Sewer and Plumbing can make a copy of your sewer scope video on a thumb drive so that you constantly have a copy for your insurance coverage real estate agent, city or company inspector.</p>
<p>No house owner wishes to deal with dysfunctional plumbing, specifically when it can cost thousands in repairs. Your houses plumbing exceeds just the pipes inside your house to the main sewer line that links to them. Most significant plumbing problems usually occur on the main line, and it's best to avoid them as much as possible. Harmed sewer lines can lead to bathrooms flooded with sewage, busted pipes, and pricey repairs.</p>
