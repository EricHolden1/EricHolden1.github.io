<p>Most softeners have a bypass built into the outlet and the inlet. By turning a valve, you can bypass the softener in case you need to provide some type of maintenance to it or perhaps while you're dealing with installing it. If the softener you pick does not have a bypass, then it's a good idea to build one out of plumbing to bypass the devices in case you need to preserve the unit.</p>
