Then that usually indicates that your main sewer line is backing up when you experience blockages in numerous drains at once in your house. This can occur in multiple places and any mix of drains. For example, water may fill up in your bathtub when you run your washing machine. There are several combinations of this type of backup. The point is your drains all link, and when you have a backup in your main sewer line, you'll experience backup and overruning from several drain lines in your house.</p>
