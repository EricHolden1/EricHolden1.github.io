Hard water causes white or gray deposits when water is warmed. Water softening can be used to decrease these signs.</p>
<p>Due to the fact that the copper pipes have actually not had a chance to become coated inside, New houses constructed with copper pipes are particularly prone to destructive water conditions. As suggested by the MDH, it is best NOT to soften the water in a brand-new home for a duration of 3 to five months after tenancy. This can be done by merely bypassing the water softener's filter medium. See your owner's manual for instructions on bypassing your softener. Lots of new houses are constructed with PEX and not copper.</p>
