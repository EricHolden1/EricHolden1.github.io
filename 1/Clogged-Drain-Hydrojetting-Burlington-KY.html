However, it includes a fair amount of functionality to the kitchen. A waste disposal unit is a relatively small cylindrical device set up under the kitchen drain. When switched on, your disposal unit pulls down wastewater and any product particles by centrifugal force. However it does not shred such debris. Rather, it grinds it into a paste at high speed so that it can easily stream into the drain pipe in addition to the rest of your wastewater.</p>
