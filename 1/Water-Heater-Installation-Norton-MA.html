<p>I had a major sewer issue with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I started calling any number I might find on Google. I really received their number for another company that couldn't come quickly enough but referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and provide me a price quote. They instantly cleared the preliminary clog, enabling the occupants to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon more investigation, there was a considerable obstruction that needed excavation to investigate. His group was on site the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this initial problem and setting up a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed. This took place yet a third time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
