<h3>Fix a Leaky Outside Frost Free Faucet in Shelbyville KY</h3>
<p>What is difficult water? Scientifically speaking, it is water which contains considerable quantities of dissolved minerals, specifically calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it gets these minerals on its journey. Depending on how long the water travels through the ground prior to reaching your tap, it can pick up a great deal of these minerals, making water harder in some regions than others. While the minerals will not damage your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water unsuitable-- and rather an annoyance-- for its numerous intended uses around your house.</p>
