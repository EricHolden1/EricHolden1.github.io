<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable water supply pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable water system pressure, or a mix of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on.
