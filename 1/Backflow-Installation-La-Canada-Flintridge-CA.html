Water pressure may be or fail decreased when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is suddenly high demand on the water system (for instance, when numerous fire hydrants are opened). Lowered pressure in the pipe may permit infected water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>

When looking for plumbing services in the area, be specific with your needs and ask prospects if they are licensed plumbers and if they have the advanced experience and licenses related to a plumbing contractor.</p>
