<p>Corrosion is a complicated phenomenon and there are lots of factors that accelerate corrosion in the drinking-water circulation system and premise plumbing. For several years, there has been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and corrosion, making it crucial to compare naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is corrosive as it has a low pH and low TDS; however, cation -exchange water softening does not add to any factors that speed up rust Likewise, there is an absence of clinical proof supporting the claim that hard-water scale is an effective kind of rust control. Hence, considering all these factors, as well as results from research studies, WQA's position is that a properly set up cation -exchange water softener does not make water more destructive.</p>
