Heating water accounts for as much as 20 percent of the typical house's energy spending plan. Some gas-fired tankless hot water heater claim to cut energy expenses by approximately half. But their added up-front expenses suggest it pays to look before you leap.</p>
<p>106.2.2 Ten-Percent Rule, General. Within the building envelope including below grade, if less than 10-percent (small) of the existing piping for a sub-system, component, or system  group is replaced, an authorization and inspection will not be required. If so wanted, this will not preclude the licensee from acquiring licenses and inspections for such work.</p>
<p>State you choose to go that route. The next concern is whether or not you can install it yourself. Put it in this manner, if you're an experienced useful person, but you have actually never managed this specific repair, you can most likely do it, providing you do your homework. I would fix a limit at trying to install a power-vented gas-fired hot water heater (and some other specific models). Their installation ought to be managed by a licensed mechanical or plumbing contractor.</p>
