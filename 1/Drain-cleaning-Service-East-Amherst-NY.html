<p>When you remove the cap to eliminate the valve, check the washer for wear or cracks. Changing a bad washer is cheap and simple. But discovering the ideal washer may not be. The most common washers are typically readily available in the house centers and hardware stores. Other designs can be difficult to discover. Eliminate it and take it to the store to discover a match if you decide to hunt for a washer. Plumbers normally replace the whole fill valve instead of hunt for a replacement washer.</p>
