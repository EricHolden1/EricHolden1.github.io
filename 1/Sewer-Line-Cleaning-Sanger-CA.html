<p>Once the parts are put back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is all set to be pressurized. It is important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on slowly while the drawback shut off remains in the closed position. This allows the parts to relocate to their pressurized positions in an accurate movement. Once the assembly is pressurized, then any accumulated air must be removed from the body. Most backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be removed from critical areas in the assembly. In some models, test dicks can be utilized to remove air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in an area where the air will collect.</p>
<h3>Fix Leaking Faucet in Sanger California</h2>
