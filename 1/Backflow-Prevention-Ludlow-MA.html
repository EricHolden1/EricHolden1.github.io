<p>Seattle Public Utilities requires that any cross connection have a backflow preventer. The backflow preventer may be required to be located on the water service line, within the building, or both areas. After a preliminary inspection and testing of a freshly installed backflow preventer, the water customer is required to have the backflow preventer evaluated on an annual basis.</p>

<h3>Why A Water Leak Detection System Is Important For Your Home in Ludlow MA</h3>
<p>What is difficult water? Scientifically speaking, it is water which contains considerable quantities of liquified minerals, particularly calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it gets these minerals on its journey. Depending upon how long the water takes a trip through the ground before reaching your tap, it can pick up a great deal of these minerals, making water harder in some areas than others. While the minerals won't harm your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water unsuitable-- and quite a nuisance-- for its lots of designated uses around your house.</p>
<p>According to the Environmental Protection Agency, cross-connections can be a serious public health hazard if they do not have appropriate backflow prevention assemblies set up. There are numerous, well-documented cases in which cross-connections have been responsible for contamination of drinking water that, when consumed, caused the spread of illness or disease.</p>
