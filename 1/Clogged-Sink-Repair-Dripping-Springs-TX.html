<h3>How to Clear Clogged Drains Without Calling a Plumber in Dripping Springs TX</h3>
<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to operate, the control valve or valves must stay open and the system must be continuously kept an eye on. For that reason, there is a device on each control valve that either avoids the valve from being closed or sends an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as easy as a locked chain through the control valve that avoids that valve from opening, or an alarm that alerts the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems make use of both methods. NFPA 13 refers to all such gadgets as supervisory gadgets.</p>
