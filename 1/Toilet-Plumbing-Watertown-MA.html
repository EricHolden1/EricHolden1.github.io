<p>If you discover an odor or unpleasant odor originating from your system, which is not unusual, think about buying a flange that can seal up and cover the top of the disposal, where nasty smells can get away. These flanges are easy and commonly offered to install, costing around $30 at home enhancement or hardware shops. Switch off the supply of water to your house at the main line. To avoid leakages from springing throughout the installation procedure, shut down the water supply to your home. Ensure your water heater's water supply is switched off, as is the electrical power going to the unit.</p>
