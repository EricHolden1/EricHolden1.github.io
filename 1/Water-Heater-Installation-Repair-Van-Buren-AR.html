Have your pipes inspected as soon as possible so you don't wind up with a significant leak.</p>
<p>If you're buying a new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large bulk of toilets, the drain is focused about 12 in. from the wall. But with a couple of designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, simply determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. Most house centers carry just one or 2 10-in. models and no 14-in. models.
