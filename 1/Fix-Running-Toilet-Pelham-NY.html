<p>As soon as the components are placed back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is ready to be pressurized. It is important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the downside shut off stays in the closed position. This allows the parts to relocate to their pressurized positions in an accurate movement. Once the assembly is pressurized, then any built up air needs to be eliminated from the body. Many backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be gotten rid of from important locations in the assembly. In some designs, test dicks can be utilized to get rid of air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a place where the air will collect.</p>
