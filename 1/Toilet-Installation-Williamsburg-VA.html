<p>Next, test the flapper as displayed in Picture 1. Water is most likely escaping through a cracked or rusted overflow tube if additional pressure on the flapper doesn't stop the running noise. Because case, you need to separate the tank from the bowl and replace the entire flush valve. Since the overflow tube is hardly ever the reason for a running toilet, we won't cover that repair here.</p>

<p>Once, the gas pipe comes up from the ground (called the riser"), it can continue to be covered, but needs to then transition to galvanized. I am not sure why that should be.
