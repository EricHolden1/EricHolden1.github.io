<h3>How To Overcome Emergency Plumbing Issues Maiden NC</h3>
<p>Contact your local authorized RainSoft dealership today for more information about the advantages of acquiring a water softening system for your house. In addition to our EC4 design, you can also inquire about our TC series water softeners, which provide similarly exceptional water softening advantages without the automated microprocessor controls of the EC4 system.</p>
<p>Water softeners overcome a process called ion exchange which gets rid of calcium and magnesium from the water. When the hard water participates in the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of round resin beads These plastic beads, usually made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, implying they have an unfavorable charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a favorable charge, making them cations. Because opposite charges bring in, the negative charge of the minerals is drawn in to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the hard water travels through the resin, the beads get ahold of the mineral ions and remove them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the salt ion is launched. The column of resin strips all the firmness out of the water as it passes through the mineral tank, and softened water flows out into your house.</p>
