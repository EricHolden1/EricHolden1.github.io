<p>To identify which toilet valve is causing the difficulty, take a look at the overflow tube. There's a problem with the toilet fill valve if water is overruning into the tube. If the water level is listed below the top of the tube, the flush valve is leaking, allowing water to drip into the bowl. That slow, continuous outflow of water prevents the fill valve from closing entirely. We cut away the fronts and backs of brand-new toilets to show you how to replace these toilet tank parts. Your toilet and toilet tank parts will not look so pristine inside. You'll find scummy surfaces, water spots and rust. However do not be squeamish-- the water is as clean as the things that comes out of your faucets.</p>
