Such connections occur naturally in home appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, but they need to be carefully developed and set up to prevent backflow. Another typical location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>
