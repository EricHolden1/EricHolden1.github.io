<p>At the top of the old disposer, put a screwdriver or the wrenchette" into the ideal side of among the lugs in the mounting ring. While holding the bottom of the disposal with the other hand, turn the installing ring counterclockwise to launch the disposal. Understand that the disposal might include water and food waste, so carry it outside right-side up.</p>
<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is only half the equation! To simply pour some media inside a tank and hope for the best is typical in our market and lots of companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Again, years of experience and thorough testing led us to design a tank that fluidizes the media bed better than any other design on the marketplace. Fluidization is the crucial to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the solidity in the water to calcite crystals which will not stick to anything even under severe temperature levels. It's only with the media and the fluidization correctly collaborating that you can attain this.</p>
