<p>Backflow indicates the unfavorable turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the drinkable supply of water; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from occurring. Points at which a safe and clean water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in home appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, but they must be thoroughly created and installed to avoid backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water system.</p>
