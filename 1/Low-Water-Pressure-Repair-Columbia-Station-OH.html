<p>Though water line replacement seems like your home's equivalent of major surgery, it's in fact something we at Gotelli Plumbing deal with frequently. When your water lines are repiped, it simply indicates old copper and galvanized pipes are changed with brand-new pipes. We discover that homes 15 years or older who have never had repiping work are the most likely candidates for water line replacement.

<p>Your disposer may feature a thin rubber gasket to be used under the sink flange, rather of the traditional plumber's putty as laid out listed below.

Some even choose silicone sealant, though it's harder to eliminate.</p>
