<p>I had a major sewer problem with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I began calling any number I might discover on Google. I actually received their number for another company that could not come soon enough but referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and provide me a quote. They instantly cleared the preliminary obstruction, allowing for the occupants to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon additional examination, there was a significant clog that needed excavation to investigate. His team was on website the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this initial issue and setting up a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a 3rd time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
