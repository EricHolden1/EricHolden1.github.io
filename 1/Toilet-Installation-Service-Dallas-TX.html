<p>Backflow suggests the unwanted turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the potable water system; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from taking place. Points at which a potable water system connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, but they must be carefully designed and set up to avoid backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>
