<p>We Can Clean Your Drains. As the pipes continue to age, flakes of rust will collect in numerous parts of the plumbing system, most typically in shower heads, faucets, and shut-off valves. This can cause low circulation issues and even stop a fixture from flowing altogether.

<p>Water softener systems work by getting rid of firmness minerals and changing them with sodium ions. Water conditioners are devices that assist avoid the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They use a physical media to prevent the scale from building up by reducing the effects of the hardness itself. Due to the reality that water conditioners use a physical media instead of a chemical media, they are in some cases thought about a greener alternative in areas where it is forbidden to utilize salt. Water conditioners do not efficiently get rid of hardness from the water supply, however, as the only method to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>
