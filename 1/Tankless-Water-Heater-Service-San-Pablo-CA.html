After we have cleaned the body, and the fixed components are still out of the body, and we have actually completed all of our part replacement and cleaning, we need to open the inlet shut down to flush any rust or particles. This can be challenging, particularly when the backflow prevention assembly is set up inside an area where water can not be wallowed.
