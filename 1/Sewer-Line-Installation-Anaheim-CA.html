The average cost to install a gas line for a kitchen stove is $15 to $25 per direct foot. Overall expenses range from $200 to $1,000 or more depending upon the length of piping required to link to the main gas supply, which normally averages 30'.</p>
<p>Sound is regular, but when you discover that the noises are all there but food is not being ground up it is most likely that the motor has actually gone. Some sounds suggest the need for repairs or a great clear out, and you can give the system a great check prior to starting to price new ones.
