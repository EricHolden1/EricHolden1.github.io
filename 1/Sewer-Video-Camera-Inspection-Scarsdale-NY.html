<p>This is the traditional question that many property owners ask themselves. Is it much better to repair their pipes or repipe them and begin fresh? The response is entirely dependent on your special circumstance. For example, if your pipe is experiencing a little leak but remains in otherwise great condition, we would recommend repairing it. However, if the pipe is continuously leaking and needs frequent repairs, we would advise repiping. At Super Plumbers, we never suggest service or products that would not truly benefit the client.</p>
