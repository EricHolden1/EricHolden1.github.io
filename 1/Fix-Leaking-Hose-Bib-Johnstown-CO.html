<h3>How To Find The Best Plumbing Services Johnstown CO</h3>
<p>Backflow suggests the unwanted reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the drinkable water supply; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from happening. Points at which a drinkable water system connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, however they must be thoroughly created and set up to avoid backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>
