<p>Follow with a plunger if the baking soda and white vinegar method does not work. Fill the sink with water and vigorously plunge up and down for numerous minutes to remove the clog. When dealing with a double bowl kitchen sink, stuff the other opening with a rag, which assists apply extra pressure to the clog. For obstructions that happen even more down the pipe, use a cable auger or plumber's snake. These tools are made of long, versatile steel cable wound around a spindle with a hand crank. To use a cable auger, get rid of the horizontal P-trap below the sink, making sure it is not clogged before continuing. Take out 18 inches of cable at a time, crank the handle in a clockwise direction and press the auger forward at the exact same time. Repeat the process, pulling out an additional 18 inches till you break through the obstruction. In some cases loose debris will settle into a new blockage. Follow with a plunger, if required.</p>
