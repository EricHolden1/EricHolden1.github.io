<h3>Clearing Blocked Drains at Lowell MI</h3>
<p>We had roots through our sewer line so it was frequently blocking. They came out and dug a new route for the line connected it to the sewer and everything. It was extremely hot and I truly value their effort to enable us to utilize our water facilities once again. Had a great experience with these folks. I extremely recommend their services.</p>
<p>If you're buying a new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast bulk of toilets, the waste pipe is focused about 12 in. from the wall. However with a couple of designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, simply measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. Most home centers bring only one or 2 10-in. models and no 14-in. models. If you have to special-order a toilet, be prepared to invest much more. Also measure how far the bowl protrudes from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are changing a toilet with a standard bowl with a lengthened" model, the door may not close. Keep reading to learn how to install a toilet.</p>
