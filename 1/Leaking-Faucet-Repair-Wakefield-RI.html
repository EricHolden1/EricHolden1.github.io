<p>So what should you do as a property owner? To start with, do not try to deal with the task of fixing the sink yourself.

Both will create a good seal (though the gasket may lead to small amounts of water gathering around the flange), and what's used is largely a matter of preference. Some even prefer silicone sealant, though it's more difficult to get rid of.</p>
