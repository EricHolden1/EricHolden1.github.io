Each and every installation should be taken a look at on a specific basis as a distinct stand-alone system. The National Fire Defense Association NFPA 13 Requirement for the installation of lawn sprinkler includes the requirement for the sprinkler systems themselves.

<p>If you're purchasing a new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast majority of toilets, the drain is focused about 12 in. from the wall. However with a couple of models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, just determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. The majority of home centers bring only one or more 10-in. designs and no 14-in. designs. If you have to special-order a toilet, be prepared to spend much more. If there's a door near the toilet, also determine how far the bowl extends from the wall. If you are replacing a toilet with a basic bowl with a lengthened" design, the door may not close.
