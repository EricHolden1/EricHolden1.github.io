<p>Back-siphonage is the reverse from normal circulation instructions within a piping system that is caused by negative pressure in the supply piping (i.e., the reversal of normal flow in a system triggered by a vacuum or partial vacuum within the supply of water piping). Back-siphonage can happen when there is a high speed in a pipe line, when there is a line repair or break that is lower than a service point, or when there is reduced main pressure due to high-water withdrawal rate (such as during fire-fighting or water-main flushing).</p>

To repair the leak, eliminate the low-pressure gas line from the gas regulator.
