The resultant space breaks any prospective siphon before it can take place, avoiding infecting water from being drawn back into the pipe system. Other laws can require the installation of more sophisticated and complex backflow preventers. And the style of these mechanical gadgets installed to avoid backflow range from the fairly simple to the extremely sophisticated and complicated.</p>
