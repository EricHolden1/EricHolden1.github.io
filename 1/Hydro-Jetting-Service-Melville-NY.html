A common water softener includes a high, narrow water-softener tank, and a short, broad salt water tank. The softener tank is linked to the house's water-supply line. A small-diameter fill tube connects the salt water tank to the softener tank. And a discharge hose ranges from the softener tank to a nearby drainpipe or drywell.</p>
<p>Professional installers use internal pipe finish to repair an existing sewer pipe that has begun to leak into surrounding soil.
