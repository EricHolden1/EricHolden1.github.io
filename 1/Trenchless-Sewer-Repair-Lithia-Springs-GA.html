It also has the disadvantage of increasing your water expense due to waste of water.</p>

<p>Wood pipes were used in London and in other places during the 17th and 16th centuries. The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a little hole in which the water would pass through. 21 The numerous pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wood pipes were used in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wood tubes were widely utilized in the USA throughout the 20th century. These pipes (utilized in place of corrugated iron or reinforced concrete pipes) were made from areas cut from brief lengths of wood. Locking of surrounding rings with hardwood dowel pins produced a flexible structure. About 100,000 feet of these wood pipes were set up during WW2 in drainage culverts, storm sewage systems and conduits, under highways and at army camps, naval stations, airfields and ordnance plants.</p>
