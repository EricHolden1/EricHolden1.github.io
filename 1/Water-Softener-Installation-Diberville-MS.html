<p>After showing up after their window, they started to investigate the kitchen sink (and after one of the 2 gentlemen threw up outdoors), they ran a snake down the sink and after that put the sink back together but declared they would not take duty if it leaked now because of some undefined oddities in how my sink was created. After they offered me the "do not put grease down the sink" lecture and they left, I observed they handled to reassemble the sink in such a way that the sprayer hose was twisted around the plumbing. I didn't even trouble to try calling them back, considering that I never ever wish to see this company once again.</p>
