<p>Backflow Preventer: A device that permits water to go through it in one direction, but prevents it from going backwards in the opposite direction.

<p>House water softeners, likewise called ion exchange units, are home appliances that remove calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for sodium or potassium. As soon as the resin beads become full of calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium solution gets rid of the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After going through the beads, the resulting chloride option becomes a waste stream that goes down the drain and eventually into the environment.</p>
<p>All piping under sinks and faucets are checked for leaks or damage.

Prior to you can ask for an inspection, you should first obtain the needed authorization( s) for the work you plan to do.

Worn impellers on older disposals can become inadequate, increasing the danger of drain blockages.</p>
