<p>As discussed earlier in the short article, carbon monoxide is colorless and totally odorless. The only test for it is a carbon monoxide detector. Every house should have carbon monoxide gas detectors set up at the appropriate areas. In California, it is a requirement for all single and multi-family houses to have both smoke and carbon monoxide detectors. They are normally offered as a 2-in-1 detector and all new installations should have a 10-year non-serviceable kind of detector.</p>
<p>The system has actually returned to a zero demand condition (no valves open downstream). However, particles between the # 1 Inspect Valve seat and sealing disc, or damage in the components, is preventing the # 1 Inspect from closing all the way.
