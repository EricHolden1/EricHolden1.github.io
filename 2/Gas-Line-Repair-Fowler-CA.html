<p>In the average repair, the old rubber parts must be eliminated and changed with new rubber parts. It is essential that only original factory repair parts are used when putting the backflow prevention assembly back together whether they are hardware or rubber parts. The rubber parts the manufacturer produces for the assembly are the only ones the assembly was designed to utilize and changing the rubber from the original factory parts will impact the operation of the backflow prevention assembly and void any approvals.</p>
<p>A waste disposal unit can minimize a home's total garbage output by crushing most common food scraps so they can be eliminated through the sink as wastewater.
