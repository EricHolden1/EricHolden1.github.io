<p>Day to day usage must not trigger a water softener to leak. Leakages can likewise happen if you bump into the softener and jostle it, pulling the fitting apart. To prevent this from taking place, install the system in a safe and stable  area. If you reside in an earthquake-prone area of the nation, protect the softener so that if the foundation begins moving, the softener doesn't fall over and rip out the plumbing. You should wait till after the cycle is finished and then inspected the system for fractures or broken fittings if your water softener is leaking during regeneration. You must also inspect to make sure your drain line is never ever blocked up with debris. A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener during regrowth and flood your basement or garage.</p>
