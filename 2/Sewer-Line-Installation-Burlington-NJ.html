Our extensive water quality program runs 24 hr a day, 365 days a year, to make sure that the water provided to our clients is kept free from damaging impurities. A vital part of our water quality program is the backflow prevention program When a water line is connected to equipment consisting of a nonpotable compound, this is known as a cross-connection. Contamination might take place when water streams through a cross-connection from a nonpotable source, such as a sprinkler system or cooling and heating system, into the potable water supply. This can happen through a process called backflow.</p>
<p>If you experience clogs and backups in your house more than a couple of times, it's a great idea to have a professional assess your drain system.
