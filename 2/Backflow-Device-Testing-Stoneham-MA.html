Each stage in the water supply and circulation system has to deal with differing flow rates, flow speeds and pressure heads, along with various levels of exposure to prospective backwash or pollutant seepage and the subsequent need for security with backflow preventers.</p>

<p>Sewer lines can stop working for a range of factors, including bad soil conditions, blockages from grease and gunk, and corrosion. Even bushes and trees can trigger problems for sewer lines, especially in older communities where clay pipe might have been used.
