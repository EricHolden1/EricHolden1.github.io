I actually got their number for another company that couldn't come quickly enough but referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and provide me a quote. They instantly cleared the preliminary obstruction, enabling the tenants to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon additional investigation, there was a substantial obstruction that required excavation to examine. His team was on site the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this preliminary problem and installing a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a 3rd time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
