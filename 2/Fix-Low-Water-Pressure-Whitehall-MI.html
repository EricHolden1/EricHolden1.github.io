However first connect the water line, flush the toilet a number of times and look for leaks. Leaving the bolts uncut until you've done these last checks lets you easily reset the toilet and get rid of if you find any problems.</p>

<p>It's a good idea to have a professional examine your drain system if you experience blockages and backups in your house more than a couple of times. A drain specialist like TLC will utilize a camera to inspect your drain system.

The camera can find and recognize the issue so the drain can be fixed.</p>
<p>Drain pipe is not protected using the required solvent cement (end of the pipe ought to be cut straight). ABS fitting is glued to PVC pipe. ABS and PVC are not actually glued in the regular sense of gluing. The so-called "glue" is really a solvent that melts the surfaces of the pipe and fitting for a couple of seconds. Broken Pipes: Pipes are broken, pierced or collapsed by shifting soil, frozen ground, settling, and so on</p>
<p>When a flush valve triggers a toilet to run, a used flapper is usually the offender. However not always. Initially, take a look at the chain that raises the flapper. It can tangle up and prevent the flapper from closing strongly if there's too much slack in the chain. A chain with too little slack can trigger trouble too. Picture 3 demonstrates how to set the slack just right.</p>
