<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, efficient, and a fantastic guy. He told me exactly what to expect (cost, time, process) in advance and delivered as guaranteed. I will absolutely utilize Clog Dawg once again. Installing a waste disposal unit takes 2 to 3 hours with an average per hour rate of $25 to $70. These rates remain in addition to the cost of the disposal unit. If your plumber has a minimum callout cost that is higher than the labor cost for the work, the total you pay may be greater.</p>
<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health danger for individuals on low sodium diets. Ion exchange increases the quantity of salt in water, in order to lower its mineral content. Usually, this process adds 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending on how hard the water was to begin with. Harder water will lead to more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this boost in salt is small, but if you've been recommended by a physician to follow a strict low salt diet this boost can position problems.</p>
