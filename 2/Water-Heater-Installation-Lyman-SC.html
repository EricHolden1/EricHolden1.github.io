<p>Difficult water triggers a higher risk of lime scale deposits in household water systems. Due to this lime scale accumulation, pipes are blocked and the performance of hot boilers and tanks is lowered. This increases the cost of domestic water heating by about fifteen to twenty percent. Dark Blue = Supply-side pressure (for example, 100 psi) pushes against the # 1 check and also fills the area on the "high pressure" side of the Relief Valve diaphram, pushing it closed.</p>
<p>Although these homeowners didn't feel fortunate at the time, it was definitely good timing to camera the line prior to collapsing. The pipe remained in sufficient shape to reline before the issue became worse. Waiting just wasn't a choice. The line was 12 feet deep and went under a separated garage. At the least, it would have been an extremely pricey option.</p>
