<p>As soon as the parts are positioned back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is ready to be pressurized. It is important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on slowly while the downside turned off stays in the closed position.

Most backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be gotten rid of from crucial locations in the assembly. In some designs, test cocks can be used to remove air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in an area where the air will build up.</p>
