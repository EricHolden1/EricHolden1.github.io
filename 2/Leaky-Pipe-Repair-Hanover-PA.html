<p>Liners are another popular product sewer cleaners offer nowadays. A liner is a fabric tube covered on one side with a layer of PVC, which is embedded with a two-part epoxy resin. Service providers then generally blow the liner into an existing pipe. If your home was constructed before the 1970s or hasn't been renovated, you will most likely have old pipes that need changing.</p>

Sewer pipes can be notoriously difficult to trace, particularly on older residential or commercial properties, so you'll want to work with someone who will trace the problem at its root cause.</p>
