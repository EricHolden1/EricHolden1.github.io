<p>The High Voltage Leak Detection Technology (HVLD) testing procedure consists of a set of electrode probes which scans a sealed container made of a non-conductive material. Some disposer units do not included a power cord attached. If this is the case, remove the plate with a screwdriver to access the electrical circuitry (Image 1). Make certain to purchase an electrical wiring set with the appropriate power rating and hardware for your disposer system (Images 2 and 3). Ensure the cable is long enough to reach the receptacle without extending the cable when you link the wiring harness to the disposer.</p>
