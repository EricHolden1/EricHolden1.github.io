<p>After getting here after their window, they started to investigate the kitchen sink (and after among the two gentlemen tossed up outdoors), they ran a snake down the sink and after that put the sink back together but claimed they wouldn't take responsibility if it leaked now due to the fact that of some undefined curiosity in how my sink was put together. After they gave me the "do not put grease down the sink" lecture and they left, I saw they handled to reassemble the sink in such a way that the sprayer hose was twisted around the plumbing. I didn't even bother to attempt calling them back, because I never ever want to see this company again.</p>
<p>Throughout installation, electrical energy and water are shut off to the area. The old plumbing and sink flange are gotten rid of and cleaned up of any putty. Loosen the nuts that link the drain pipe, including the curved trap, at the sink drain and near the wall or floor. Utilize your hands for PVC connections or a pipe wrench for metal connections. Place a pail below the drain pipe to catch any water that leakages out.</p>
