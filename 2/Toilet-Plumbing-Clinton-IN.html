<p>If your water heater has actually required numerous repairs over the last few years, it may be time to get it changed. A good rule of thumb for water heaters is this: due to the fact that the life-span of the typical water heater is between 8-12 years, around 5-6 years is the middle. It makes more monetary sense to replace your water heater if the cost of a repair is more than half the cost of a replacement at that point.</p>
<p>Single flush High Effectiveness Toilets (HETs) utilize 1.28 gallons per flush. The latest dual flush HET provided by Bonney will utilize approximately 1.1 gallons per flush.

Appropriate care and garbage disposal maintenance will keep it running long past its service warranty and keep your drain lines clear.</p>
