<p>The law also requires yearly testing and inspection by a certified tester, and a report sent to the DEP. Failure to comply can result in charges and termination of water service. Because backflow preventer devices are comprised of moving seals, parts, and springs and are subject to corrosive substances, wear, and fatigue, it's vital to properly preserve them to ensure they correctly run and play their part in keeping our city's drinking water safe.</p>
<p>Plumbing is the practice, components and materials utilized in the installation, maintenance, extension, and alteration of all piping, components, plumbing devices, and plumbing appurtenances in connection with hygienic drainage or storm drainage facilities; venting systems and public or personal water supply systems, within or adjacent to any structure or structure.</p>
