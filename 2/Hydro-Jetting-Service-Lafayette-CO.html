<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is just half the formula! To just put some media inside a tank and wish for the very best is typical in our market and many companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Again, years of experience and comprehensive testing led us to develop a tank that fluidizes the media bed better than any other style on the market.
