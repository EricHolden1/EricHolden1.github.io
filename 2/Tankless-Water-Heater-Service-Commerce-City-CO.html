<p>We truly care about our consumers and the services that we offer. As tough water passes through a softener, the calcium and magnesium trade locations with sodium ions (Figure 1). Sodium ions are held loosely and are changed easily by calcium and magnesium ions. During this process, complimentary" sodium ions are released into the water. The time between charging cycles depends on the hardness of the water, the quantity of water utilized, the size of the unit and the capability of the exchange media to get rid of solidity.</p>
<p>To figure out if your home is a poly home," begin with the exterior. Underground water mains are normally blue in color (they can also be black or gray).
