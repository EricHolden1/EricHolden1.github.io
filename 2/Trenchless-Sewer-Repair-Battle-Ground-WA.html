<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Decreases in drinkable water supply pressure happen whenever the amount of water being utilized exceeds the quantity of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
