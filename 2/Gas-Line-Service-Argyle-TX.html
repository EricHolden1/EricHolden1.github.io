<p>Throughout typical operation, the pressure in between the 2 check valves, described as the zone of lowered pressure, is maintained at a lower pressure than the supply pressure. If either check valve must leak, the relief valve is designed to open and release water to the outside. An RPZ will regularly release small amounts of water due to variation in line pressure up or downstream of the assembly. For this factor, the RPZ needs to be installed in areas that are not subject to water damage and permit sufficient drainage.</p>
