<p>Do you notice that you have dry or flaky skin, or does your water have a chemical or rotten egg odor? Sewer line repair is suggested when there are cracks or holes in your sewer line.

Slip the mounting ring onto the flange then slide on the breeze ring up until it snaps into location. Equally tighten the 3 mounting bolts, sealing the flange firmly versus the sink. Get rid of excess plumber's putty.</p>
<p>If there is backflow at your home, you might pollute your drinking water with non-treated water from a watering canal or water pooled around a sprinkler head that has fertilizer on it.
