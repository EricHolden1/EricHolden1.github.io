<p>If you're buying a new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast majority of toilets, the waste pipe is focused about 12 in. from the wall. However with a couple of designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, simply measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts.

If you need to special-order a toilet, be prepared to spend a lot more. If there's a door near the toilet, likewise measure how far the bowl protrudes from the wall.
