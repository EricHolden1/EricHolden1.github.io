If you reside in an earthquake-prone area of the nation, secure the softener so that if the structure starts moving, the softener doesn't fall over and rip out the plumbing. You should wait until after the cycle is finished and then checked the system for cracks or broken fittings if your water softener is leaking throughout regrowth. You must also inspect to make certain your drain line is never ever blocked up with particles. A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener during regrowth and flood your basement or garage.</p>
