<p>To prep your system for installation, you may need to connect a cable with a plug to reach the outlet, or extension wires to reach a hardwired box In this case, I attached a cable with a plug set that I bought independently from the disposal system. It's as easy as feeding the wires from the cord through the disposal and connecting them to the matching colors on the unit with wire nuts.</p>
<p>Galvanized water piping rusts and wears away internally. When drawing water from galvanized water pipes, particles of rust, zinc, and other impurities circulation into your drinking water.
