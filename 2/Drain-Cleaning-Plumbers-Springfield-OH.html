<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, efficient, and an excellent person. He informed me exactly what to anticipate (cost, time, procedure) up front and delivered as promised. I will definitely utilize Clog Dawg once again. Setting up a waste disposal unit takes 2 to 3 hours with an average hourly rate of $25 to $70. These rates remain in addition to the cost of the disposal unit. The overall you pay might be higher if your plumber has a minimum callout cost that is higher than the labor cost for the work.</p>
