<p>Some manufacturers claim that the electrical devices they produce can affect the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surface areas. Since these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like standard water softeners do, one advantage declared for the user is the removal of the need to add salt to the system. While particle size decrease and plant growth promotion have actually been declared, such systems do not get rid of minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only alter the downstream effects that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of specific systems has revealed a reduction of calcium scale formation. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>
<p>The schedule of warm running water in many homes is vital for daily living. From laundry, bathing and baths, to washing the dishes, regular hand-washing, and even cooking, water is important, and it will be used in varying heat. All this is dependent on having a running water heater. If you sum up all that demand, it is easy to see the pressure placed on the heater.</p>
