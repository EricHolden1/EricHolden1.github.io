<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is only half the formula! To simply put some media inside a tank and wish for the very best is typical in our industry and lots of companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Once again, years of experience and thorough testing led us to design a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other design on the marketplace. Fluidization is the key to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the hardness in the water to calcite crystals which will not stick to anything even under severe temperatures. It's just with the media and the fluidization correctly working together that you can achieve this.</p>
