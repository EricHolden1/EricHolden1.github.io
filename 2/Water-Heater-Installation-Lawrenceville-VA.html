<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to run, the control valve or valves should remain open and the system should be continually kept an eye on. Therefore, there is a device on each control valve that either prevents the valve from being closed or sends out an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as easy as a locked chain through the control valve that avoids that valve from opening, or an alarm that notifies the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems make use of both approaches. NFPA 13 refers to all such gadgets as supervisory devices.</p>
