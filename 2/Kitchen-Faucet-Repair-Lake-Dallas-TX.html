Moreover, customers generally have absolute faith that water provided to them through a public water system is constantly safe to drink.

<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is only half the formula! To just put some media inside a tank and expect the very best is normal in our market and numerous companies try to get away with it.

Fluidization is the key to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the solidity in the water to calcite crystals which will not stick to anything even under extreme temperature levels. It's just with the media and the fluidization properly working together that you can attain this.</p>
