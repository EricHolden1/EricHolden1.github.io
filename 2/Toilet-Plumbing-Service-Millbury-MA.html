<h3>Signs That Your Water Heater Needs To Be Repaired Or Replaced in Millbury MA</h3>
<p>Deterioration is an intricate phenomenon and there are numerous factors that speed up deterioration in the drinking-water circulation system and property plumbing. For years, there has been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and rust, making it essential to distinguish between naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is destructive as it has a low pH and low TDS; however, cation -exchange water softening does not contribute to any aspects that speed up rust Likewise, there is a lack of scientific proof supporting the claim that hard-water scale is an efficient type of rust control. Thus, thinking about all these factors, along with results from research study studies, WQA's position is that an effectively configured cation -exchange water softener does not make water more destructive.</p>
