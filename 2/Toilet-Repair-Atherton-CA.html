<h3>Leak Repair in Atherton California</h2>
<p>The upstairs main kitchen drain was clogged with a couple of years of gunk and had backed up into the downstairs bathroom sink. Mr. Singh did at least 3 attempts to clear the main drain, but the downstairs sink still had standing water in the bowl. Utilizing his knowledge and experience he determined that the drain system from the upstairs sink was clear but the backup was in the branch to the downstairs sink.

<p>Throughout regular operation, the pressure between the 2 check valves, referred to as the zone of lowered pressure, is kept at a lower pressure than the supply pressure. The relief valve is developed to open and release water to the outside if either check valve must leak. An RPZ will periodically release small amounts of water due to variation in line pressure up or downstream of the assembly. For this reason, the RPZ needs to be installed in locations that are not subject to water damage and permit adequate drainage.</p>
