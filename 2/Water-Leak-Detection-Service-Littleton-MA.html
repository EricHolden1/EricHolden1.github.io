<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and added two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the previous. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was rather affordable. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was very pleased with their service.</p>
<p>If you're buying a brand-new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge bulk of toilets, the waste pipe is centered about 12 in. from the wall. But with a few designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, simply measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. A lot of house centers bring only one or two 10-in. models and no 14-in. models. If you have to special-order a toilet, be prepared to invest much more. If there's a door near the toilet, likewise measure how far the bowl extends from the wall. If you are replacing a toilet with a standard bowl with an elongated" design, the door may not close. Continue reading to discover how to install a toilet.</p>
