<h3>Plumber Plumbing Contractor Crestview FL</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adjust to your company' flow rates throughout the day. During durations of high circulation demand, tanks come online to include flow rate capacity. Throughout periods of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called responsive or progressive flow technology, and it's perhaps the most crucial innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
