<h3>Plumber Installation & Repair Service Garland TX</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to handle peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively get used to your organisation' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high flow demand, tanks come online to add circulation rate capacity. During durations of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive flow technology, and it's probably the most essential innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
