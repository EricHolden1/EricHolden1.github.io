<p>If you are choosing between repairing and replacing, there are a couple of different components to take into consideration. Initially, you need to think about for how long you have actually had your existing system. A repair is more cost reliable if your water heater is under 5 years.

<p>Electric water heaters do have a couple of disadvantages however that are worth explaining. Primarily, electricity is not as cheap as gas. Some energy companies charge higher rates for electrical energy during peak durations such as very early in the morning and in the evening.
