When a brand-new house is built, water pipes need to be run, and toilets, sinks and faucets need to be set up correctly and to local, state, and federal code.

<p>Difficult water is softened by removing the calcium and magnesium it consists of. When tough water travels through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (firmness) ions are gotten rid of through an ion exchange procedure, so only softened water passes through to your house.

Salt is typically used in the regeneration procedure and restores the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange process can begin once again.</p>
