<p>Visible odor. The minute you smell sewage (a rotten egg-like odor) in the backyard, basement, or throughout your house or service location, give us a call. That smell might be originating from your sewer system, which requires repair work right away. If your vent stack, the part of your plumbing system that removes sewage from your house, releases sewer gas, and manages atmospheric pressure in the waste-system pipes has stopped working, it will frequently need to be changed rather than fixed. You'll understand this if your pipes are gurgling or discharging nasty odors.</p>
<p>So what should you do as a house owner? Firstly, do not try to deal with the task of repairing the sink yourself. Work with a professional plumber to manage the task of your sink repair if you want to prevent significant water line damage.

On the contrary, at Norwalk Plumbing Heating & Cooling our professional sink specialists will repair your sink quickly and without triggering more damage.</p>
