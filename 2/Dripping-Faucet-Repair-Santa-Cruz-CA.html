<h3>Why A Water Leak Detection System Is Important For Your Home in Santa Cruz CA</h3>
<p>Domestic water that gets here to your Ohio house brings minerals that can trigger rust on metal parts and parts. To prevent rust from rust, storage tanks are equipped with a bar made with magnesium called an anode rod. The rod protects the tank by attracting harmful materials. By having the anode rod checked regularly and replaced as needed, you can double the life of your water heater.</p>
<p>According to the Environmental Protection Agency, cross-connections can be a major public health hazard if they do not have adequate backflow prevention assemblies installed. There are various, well-documented cases in which cross-connections have actually been responsible for contamination of drinking water that, when consumed, triggered the spread of sickness or disease.</p>
<p>Backpressure is developed when pressure in a water system surpasses the pressure in the safe and clean system offering the cosmetics water. This can force the safe and clean water to reverse its direction of flow through the cross-connection in between the two systems. Prospective pollutants can then go into the drinkable water supply. The best method to minimize build-up is have a professional flush it at least once a year. In some areas of Virginia, where the water is specifically difficult with high mineral content, you may need to flush the water heater more often.</p>
