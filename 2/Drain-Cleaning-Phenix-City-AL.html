<h3>Water Heater Repair in Phenix City Alabama</h2>
<p>A partial reroute is basically a small scale repiping of several affected locations of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost effective, it is possible to only abandon the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, walls and attics. Costing less than a complete repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can build up in cost extremely rapidly. This is the main reason why we will suggest a full repipe in specific areas, based on our experience.</p>
