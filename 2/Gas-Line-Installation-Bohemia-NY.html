<p>I had a significant sewer concern with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I began calling any number I could discover on Google. I really received their number for another company that couldn't come soon enough but referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and give me an estimate. They immediately cleared the initial clog, allowing for the tenants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon more examination, there was a considerable obstruction that needed excavation to examine. His team was on site the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this initial issue and setting up a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed. This took place yet a third time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
