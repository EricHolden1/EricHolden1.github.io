<p>A testable backflow prevention device has 2 check valves-- basically two layers of protection. The device permits water to push the check valves open when water is coming into the structure, but closes them shut when water tries to go the wrong way. There are two different kinds of testable backflow prevention devices that are frequently specified-- a decreased pressure zone backflow device and a check backflow device. There are a couple of others that I will discuss however do not get hung up on them. Because they will be on a certification test, I discuss them only.</p>

<h3>Clearing Blocked Drains at Rhome TX</h3>
<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and included 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always leaked in the past. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was quite sensible. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was incredibly delighted with their service.</p>
