<p>If you decide to attempt this job yourself, be prepared to keep meticulous track of about a lots tiny parts (put the stopper in the sink so none of them drop the drain). There are various faucet styles, so you might not have the ability to inform what to replace till you have actually done the disassembly. Whether you do it yourself or work with a plumber, this would be a great time to think of whether you want to upgrade the faucet with a new style.</p>
