<p>This is a totally legitimate concern that we hear a lot. The disposal unit is not, of course, as essential as your water heater, water line, or drainpipes. Nonetheless, it includes a reasonable amount of functionality to the kitchen. A garbage disposal is a relatively small round device set up under the kitchen drain. When turned on, your disposal unit pulls down wastewater and any material debris by centrifugal force. However it does not shred such particles.
