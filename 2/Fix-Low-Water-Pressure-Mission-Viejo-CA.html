An important part of our water quality program is the backflow prevention program When a water line is linked to equipment consisting of a nonpotable compound, this is known as a cross-connection. Contamination might take place when water streams through a cross-connection from a nonpotable source, such as a lawn sprinkler or heating & cooling system, into the safe and clean water system. This can take place through a procedure called backflow.</p>
<p>The simplest method to keep you and your family safe from the prospective dangers of backflow through cross connections is to not produce cross connections in the first location. Nevertheless, if you do have a cross connection to a sprinkler system system, boiler, pool, water feature or other kind of cross connection, have an approved backflow prevention assembly set up.</p>
