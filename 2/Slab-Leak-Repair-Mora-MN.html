<p>You'll notice that water runs to refill the bowl Whenever you flush your toilet. However, in an effectively working toilet, the water should stop running when the bowl is filled to its suitable capability. Opportunities are you have an internal leak and water is being disposed down the overflow if your toilet continues to run. These leaks are very inefficient, as more than a hundred gallons of water end up traveling through the overflow.</p>
<p>When a flush valve causes a toilet to run, a worn flapper is generally the perpetrator. But not always. First, take a look at the chain that raises the flapper. If there's too much slack in the chain, it can tangle up and avoid the flapper from closing strongly. A chain with too little slack can trigger problem too. Image 3 shows how to set the slack perfect.</p>
