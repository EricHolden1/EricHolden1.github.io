<p>The main difference among water softener designs is in the method they set up the backflush cycles. This is very important due to the fact that charging the beads with salt prematurely wastes salt and water. Charging far too late causes efficiency to fall off.

More difficult water will lead to more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this boost in sodium is minor, however if you have actually been encouraged by a physician to follow a stringent low salt diet this increase can posture problems.</p>
