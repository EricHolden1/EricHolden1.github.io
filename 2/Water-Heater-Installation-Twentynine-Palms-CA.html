<p>If there is backflow at your home, you might pollute your drinking water with non-treated water from a watering canal or water pooled around a sprinkler head that has fertilizer on it.

<p>Back-siphonage is the reverse from regular circulation direction within a piping system that is brought on by negative pressure in the supply piping (i.e., the reversal of normal circulation in a system brought on by a vacuum or partial vacuum within the water system piping). Back-siphonage can occur when there is a high velocity in a pipe line, when there is a line repair or break that is lower than a service point, or when there is decreased main pressure due to high-water withdrawal rate (such as throughout fire-fighting or water-main flushing).</p>
<p>Our experts need to address a clogged toilet as quickly as possible to avoid possible, major damage to your home. Waste can quickly back-up into your tub or shower and even your sinks.

<p>Throughout regular operation, the pressure in between the 2 check valves, described as the zone of decreased pressure, is maintained at a lower pressure than the supply pressure. If either check valve should leak, the relief valve is created to release and open water to the outside. An RPZ will periodically discharge small amounts of water due to change in line pressure up or downstream of the assembly. For this reason, the RPZ needs to be set up in areas that are not subject to water damage and allow appropriate drainage.</p>
