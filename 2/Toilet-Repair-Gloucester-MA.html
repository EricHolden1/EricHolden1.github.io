That smell may be originating from your sewer system, which needs repair right now. If your vent stack, the part of your plumbing system that gets rid of sewage from your house, releases sewer gas, and regulates air pressure in the waste-system pipes has actually failed, it will typically need to be replaced rather than fixed.
