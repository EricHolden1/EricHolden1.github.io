More recent units use digital sensors that keep an eye on bead deficiency and other key metrics based upon your water use and for that reason only regenerate when required. These newer systems, also described as demand-initiated regeneration softeners, are ideal due to the fact that they conserve energy and money-- using less water and salt for regrowth.</p>
