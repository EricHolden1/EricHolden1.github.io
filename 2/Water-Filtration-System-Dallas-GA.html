<p>Discover if there are any lead pipes in the home. Homes that were developed prior to 1986 typically have lead or galvanized plumbing. Lead, as you understand, no matter how beneficial, is an ecological toxin (note the need for unleaded gas and paint in houses that is not lead based). You might not desire to live in a home that has lead pipes if you have children.</p>
<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is only half the equation! To just pour some media inside a tank and expect the very best is typical in our industry and numerous companies try to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Again, years of experience and comprehensive testing led us to create a tank that fluidizes the media bed better than any other design on the market. Fluidization is the essential to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the hardness in the water to calcite crystals which will not stick to anything even under severe temperatures. It's just with the media and the fluidization effectively working together that you can achieve this.</p>
