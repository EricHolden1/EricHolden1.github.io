Make sure to acquire a wiring package with the correct power score and hardware for your disposer unit (Images 2 and 3). Guarantee the cable is long enough to reach the receptacle without extending the cord when you connect the circuitry harness to the disposer.</p>
<p>You also need to purchase a backflow valve if you discover your water has an uncommon circulation, taste, smell or color. A plumbing professional can figure out whether the problem with your faucet is a quick fix or the result of other problems in your house's plumbing system.
