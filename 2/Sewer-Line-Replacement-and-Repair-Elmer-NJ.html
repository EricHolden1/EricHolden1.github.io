<p>The Plumbing Inspections group is consisted of six State of Ohio-certified plumbing inspectors, one of which is also functions as the Supervising Inspector and the Plumbing Plan Inspector for the group. There are few instances when plumbing inspections are mandatory, however the biggest exceptions are construction and home updates.
