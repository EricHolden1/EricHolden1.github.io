When tough water passes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (firmness) ions are eliminated through an ion exchange process, so just softened water passes through to your home. Once the resin bed fills with solidity ions, it must be restored (cleaned). Salt is usually utilized in the regeneration procedure and brings back the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange procedure can begin once again.</p>
