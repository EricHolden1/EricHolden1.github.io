<p>The toilet takes an actually long time to flush. Here's how it works: Throughout normal operation, the pressure in between the two check valves-- referred to as the zone of minimized pressure-- is preserved at a lower pressure than the supply pressure. If either check valve need to leak, the relief valve is designed to discharge and open water to the outside, making sure backflow never ever happens.</p>
<p>Many homes or structures that were constructed in the 1970s typically have galvanized piping. Over time, the plumbing system can break and the pipes can begin to wear away. This can cause low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to provide weather security. As the external covering of zinc begins to erode, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, triggering the iron to eventually rust.</p>
