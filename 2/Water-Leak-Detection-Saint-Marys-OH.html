<p>Most homes or buildings that were built in the 1970s usually have galvanized piping. With time, the plumbing system can break and the pipes can begin to corrode. This can cause low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to provide weather protection. As the external finish of zinc starts to erode, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, causing the iron to ultimately rust.</p>
<p>Call 831-393-9321 for reliable and fast water heater solutions. When you work with our Beachfront plumbers, experience true quality service. If your disposal is clogged, don't use harsh drain cleaning chemicals to try to unclog the system. Chemicals can harm the mechanical parts, shortening the life of the disposal. Only a plumber with experience in repiping can tell you that you need new pipes. Nevertheless, there are some signs that you may need pipe repair services-- or a total pipe replacement. While other things might be to blame, call a plumbing company right away if you notice any of the following concerns.</p>
