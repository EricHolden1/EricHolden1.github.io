<p>If you discover an odor or unpleasant smell coming from your system, which is not unusual, think about buying a flange that can seal up and cover the top of the disposal, where nasty smells can get away. These flanges are simple and commonly readily available to install, costing around $30 in your home improvement or hardware shops. Switch off the water supply to your house at the main line.
