For years, there has been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and deterioration, making it crucial to distinguish between naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is corrosive as it has a low pH and low TDS; nevertheless, cation -exchange water softening does not add to any aspects that accelerate corrosion Also, there is an absence of scientific evidence supporting the claim that hard-water scale is an effective form of deterioration control. Hence, thinking about all these elements, in addition to results from research studies, WQA's position is that an effectively configured cation -exchange water softener does not make water more corrosive.</p>
