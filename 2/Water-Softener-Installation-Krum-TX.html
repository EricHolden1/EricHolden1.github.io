<p>PEX pipes were thought to be a better alternative to polybutylene and galvanized piping. Sadly, one brand is experiencing a great deal of problems: Dura PEX. Dura PEX tends to have a lot of oxidization. This triggers fractures in the tubing that can result in leakages. As these leaks occur, zinc is leached from the fittings on the pipes, triggering them to deteriorate. Lastly, chlorinated water has been discovered to trigger fractures in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the best option to all of these problems.</p>
<p>You have galvanized iron pipes. I had Rate Busters replace a water heater tank and a main water turned off valve. They were prompt and extremely responsive to send me a quote which was very competitive. They were very professional and did an incredible job. I would definitely call them once again for my plumbing needs. Now, if this discoloration just appears when hot water is being utilized, then the rust most likely exists within your water heater tank and not in your pipes. This is of course still an issue that needs to be handled right away (you'll likely need a brand-new hot water heater) however not one that requires repiping.</p>
