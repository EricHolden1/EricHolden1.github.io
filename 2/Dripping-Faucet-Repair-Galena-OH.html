<p>If you're purchasing a brand-new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast majority of toilets, the drain is centered about 12 in. from the wall. However with a couple of designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, just measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. Most home centers bring only one or 2 10-in. designs and no 14-in. models.
