<p>When the information gathered from the field test indicates the assembly has actually broken down in its efficiency below the established minimum standard, backflow preventers ought to only be repaired. The test treatment is a diagnostic assessment of the functions of a backflow preventer. When the backflow preventer stops working to fulfill this minimum basic, the backflow preventer must be fixed or if needed, replaced. These minimum standards are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly begins to degrade in its performance, it can still prevent backflow. The function of a repair is to return the assembly back to its initial factory working specs. This suggests the assembly is fixed so that it can carry out above the minimum standard.</p>
