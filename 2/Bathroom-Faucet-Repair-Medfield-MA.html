<p>As a NECESSARY SERVICES ORGANISATIONS, we remain OPEN and available to assist with any of your plumbing, drain, heating, air conditioning or electrical needs. The waste disposal unit is among the most misused devices in the whole house. Couple of homeowners realize that a disposal is designed specifically to handle food residue washed from a plate-- not whole pieces of leftovers! Large quantities of food can rapidly overwhelm the system and cause an extensive clog. That's why Pratt Plumbing receives numerous phone calls requesting waste disposal unit repairs and maintenance.</p>
<p>As water goes through the supply pipes and then out the faucets, showerheads, icemaker, washing machine, water heater, dishwasher, and boiler, it's leaving behind hard, crusty mineral deposits. Initially, these little deposits are safe, but gradually they develop and ultimately clog pipes, seize valves, and plug aerators and showerheads. In extreme cases, hard-water deposits can drastically restrict the water flow, which puts unnecessary pressure on the entire plumbing system.</p>
