An example is when the public utility needs to shut off the water to repair a pipes, or link a brand-new pipe. This makes building and construction jobs easily the most typical cause of backflow problems. Fire fighting is another typical cause of backflow. Fire trucks use substantial pumps to draw the water out of the fire hydrants.

These minimum standards are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly starts to weaken in its efficiency, it can still avoid backflow. The purpose of a repair is to return the assembly back to its initial factory working specifications. This means the assembly is repaired so that it can carry out above the minimum requirement.</p>
