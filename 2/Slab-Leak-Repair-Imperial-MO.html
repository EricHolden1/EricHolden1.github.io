Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable water system pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in drinkable water supply pressure take place whenever the amount of water being used exceeds the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
