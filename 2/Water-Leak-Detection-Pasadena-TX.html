This guarantees most of your plumbing and devices are reaping the benefits of bring the softened water. It's specifically crucial to make certain your water softener is located before your hot water heater, as tough water does the greatest damage to hot water home appliances.

It will need to be near the water's main line, an electric outlet to switch on the system, and a drain for the brine solution from the regeneration cycle.</p>

Scale develops in your pipes, clogging them and decreasing water pressure.  Scale dramatically reduces the lifespan of home appliances like dishwashing machines, coffee machine and ice machines.
