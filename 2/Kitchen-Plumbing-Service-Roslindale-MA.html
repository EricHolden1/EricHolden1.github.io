<p>As a locally-owned company, integrity and duty are extremely crucial to constructing a credibility for quality. One common way for a home's water supply to be contaminated is if the watering water lines, which could end up being tainted by pesticides or weed poison, backflow into the interior water lines. The issue might spread out greatly if that contaminated water were to backflow into the neighborhood drinking supply. A backflow preventer not only protects drinking water in individual residences, it likewise avoids wastewater in private houses from flowing back out and contaminating the general public water supply.</p>
<p>The Department of Public Health charges a $100 fee for plumbing authorizations. All license costs are payable by check or cash order only. Make payments to the State of Delaware.
