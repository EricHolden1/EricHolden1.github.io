Both might hold true; neither may be true; one or the other might be true. The only method to know for sure is, first, get a video inspection done, and then start the procedure of finding a solution for your slow drains.</p>
<p>While water temperature level change could be credited to your hot water heater, the plumbing pipes could likewise be the main culprit.

<p>Clark's Process: This process is also called lime softening. The chemical calcium hydroxide, called limewater, is added to water, which causes the solidity ions to speed up.

However, it adds a fair quantity of functionality to the kitchen. A waste disposal unit is a reasonably small cylindrical device set up under the kitchen drain. When turned on, your disposal unit pulls down wastewater and any material particles by centrifugal force. But it does not shred such debris. Rather, it grinds it into a paste at high speed so that it can easily flow into the drain pipe along with the rest of your wastewater.</p>
