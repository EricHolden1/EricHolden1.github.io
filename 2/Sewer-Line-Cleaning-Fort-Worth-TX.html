<p>I had a significant sewer issue with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I began calling any number I might find on Google. I actually got their number for another company that couldn't come quickly enough but referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and provide me a quote. They right away cleared the preliminary obstruction, enabling the tenants to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon further examination, there was a substantial blockage that needed excavation to investigate. His team was on website the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this initial issue and setting up a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This took place yet a third time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
