Because these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like standard water softeners do, one advantage declared for the user is the elimination of the need to include salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant growth promo have been claimed, such systems do not remove minerals from the water itself.

See your owner's manual for instructions on bypassing your softener. Many brand-new houses are developed with PEX and not copper.</p>
