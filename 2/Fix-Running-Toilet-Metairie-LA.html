This can cause low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have actually been coded with zinc to supply weather security. As the outer finishing of zinc begins to wear down, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, triggering the iron to ultimately rust.</p>
