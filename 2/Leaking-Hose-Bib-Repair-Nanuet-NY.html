<p>Many homes or buildings that were constructed in the 1970s typically have galvanized piping. Over time, the plumbing system can break and the pipes can start to rust. This can cause low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to supply weather security. As the outer finish of zinc starts to deteriorate, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, causing the iron to eventually rust.</p>
<p>In many cases, a lack of hot water is brought on by a faulty circuit breaker or a broken high-temperature cutoff switch. If the water is lukewarm, the dip tube inside the tank might be cracked. Scalding water is usually the outcome of a damaged pressure relief valve or a bad thermostat. In either case, scalding water threatens and must be right away attended to by an experienced plumbing professional.</p>
