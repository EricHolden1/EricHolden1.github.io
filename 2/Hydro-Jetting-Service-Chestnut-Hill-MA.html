<p>The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania currently has no licensure or certification requirements for the majority of building contractors (or their workers). Reattach the gas tank to the Weed Eater trimmer with the Torx screws that held it in place initially. Reattach the fuel lines to the carburetor in the same positions as they were originally put. Reconnect the spark plug wire.
