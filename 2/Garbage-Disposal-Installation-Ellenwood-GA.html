<p>As water goes through the supply pipes and after that out the faucets, showerheads, icemaker, washing machine, water boiler, dishwasher, and heater, it's leaving hard, crusty mineral deposits.

<p>As soon as, the gas pipe turns up from the ground (called the riser"), it can continue to be wrapped, but needs to then transition to galvanized. I am unsure why that need to be.

PG&E frequently does this when plumbing in their gas meters.</p>

<p>Loose flanges are usually the result of wood rot. The flange screws simply will not hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best option depends on the extent of the rot. Use an ear-type repair ring if the rot is just under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into company wood further away from the flange. Before you install this type of ring, hold it approximately the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may need to cut off a number of ears to make it deal with your toilet. You'll have to replace an area of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
