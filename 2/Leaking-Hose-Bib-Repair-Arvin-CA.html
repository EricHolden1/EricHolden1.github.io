<p>New England Pipe Repair is the premier sewer repair service provider in the Northeast. While this may appear like a problem with your faucet, it's typically triggered by something else - like a plumbing problem or problem with your water heater. More and more people are trading in their old water heaters for new, tankless variations.

<p>Pretty little flappers may get all the glory in the toilet world, but the trip lever is the bridge in between guy and machine. After all, if the trip lever doesn't raise the flapper to flush the toilet, you need to jiggle and wiggle and often even stick your hand in there and lift the flapper manually. And who wishes to do all that work??? In all seriousness though, making sure your journey lever is working well can conserve you the hassle of those little daily troubles - that many people just deal with and never realize they can fix in about 5 minutes - not to discuss the gallons of water wasted every day by a bad seal.</p>

The results of hard water can be seen on your dishes, the color and softness of your clothing, the movie on your shower door and even your individual appearance and convenience.</p>
