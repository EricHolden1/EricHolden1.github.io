<h3>Benefits Of Commercial Plumbing Services New Brighton PA</h3>
<p>Backflow means the undesirable turnaround of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the potable supply of water; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from taking place. Points at which a safe and clean water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, however they need to be thoroughly designed and set up to avoid backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>
