Scale builds up in your pipes, blocking them and reducing water pressure.  Scale significantly shortens the lifespan of appliances like dishwashers, coffee machine and ice makers. Hard water destroys hot water appliances.

<p>A garbage disposal should not leak. It normally suggests wear and tear which is a fair indication that its time is up when this occurs. If you consider what you put down the disposal, leaks can be unclean and will also eventually trigger pressure on other parts of your garbage disposal. The kitchen sink drain might need a basic tightening or a replacement. If the leak remains in the pressurized hose spray, you will see the apparent spray. For a leak in the drain pipe, you might have to fill the sink with water prior to examining the pipe beneath.</p>

Lead, as you know, no matter how useful, is an environmental contaminant (note the need for unleaded gas and paint in houses that is not lead based). You might not want to live in a home that has lead pipes if you have kids.</p>
