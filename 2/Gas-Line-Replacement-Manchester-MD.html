<p>The High Voltage Leak Detection Innovation (HVLD) testing process consists of a set of electrode probes which scans a sealed container made of a non-conductive product. Some disposer systems do not come with a power cable attached. If this is the case, remove the plate with a screwdriver to access the electrical circuitry (Image 1). Make certain to buy a wiring set with the correct power ranking and hardware for your disposer system (Images 2 and 3). Ensure the cable is long enough to reach the receptacle without stretching the cord when you link the circuitry harness to the disposer.</p>
