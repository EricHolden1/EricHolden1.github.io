<h3>Plumbing, Drains & Water Cleanup South Hadley MA</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to manage peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to efficiently get used to your business' flow rates throughout the day. During durations of high circulation demand, tanks come online to add flow rate capability. During periods of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This new method to softening is called progressive or responsive flow technology, and it's probably the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
