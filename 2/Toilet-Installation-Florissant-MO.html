<p>New homes built with copper pipes are especially vulnerable to destructive water conditions since the copper pipes have actually not had a chance to become coated inside. As advised by the MDH, it is best NOT to soften the water in a new home for a duration of three to 5 months after occupancy. This can be done by just bypassing the water softener's filter medium.
