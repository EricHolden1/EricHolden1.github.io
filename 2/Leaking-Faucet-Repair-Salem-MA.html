<p>Pre-action sprinkler systems normally are installed in areas where water could trigger devastating damage, such as in freezers, computer spaces, and areas with electronic equipment. The piping in a pre-action system includes air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is held back by the pre-action valve, which is connected to a fire detection system. If a fire takes place, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then enables water into the system's piping. The water is discharged through the open sprinkler.</p>

<p>Though water line replacement sounds like your house's equivalent of significant surgery, it's in fact something we at Gotelli Plumbing deal with often. When your water lines are repiped, it just means old copper and galvanized pipes are replaced with new pipes. We find that houses 15 years or older who have never had repiping work are the most likely prospects for water line replacement. If you have an older house and are experiencing significant and frequent leakages, you could be in need of water line repiping. We find that repiping can really be the cheaper and much better long-lasting service if you do have frequent leakages.</p>
<p>To prep your unit for installation, you might have to connect a cord with a plug to reach the outlet, or extension wires to reach a hardwired box In this case, I connected a cable with a plug set that I bought individually from the disposal system. It's as simple as feeding the wires from the cable through the disposal and attaching them to the matching colors on the unit with wire nuts.</p>
