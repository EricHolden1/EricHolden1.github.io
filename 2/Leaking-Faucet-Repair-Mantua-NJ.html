<p>I had a major sewer concern with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I began calling any number I might discover on Google. I really got their number for another company that could not come quickly enough but referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to examine and give me a price quote. They immediately cleared the initial obstruction, permitting the occupants to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon additional examination, there was a significant clog that required excavation to investigate. His group was on website the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this preliminary issue and setting up a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This took place yet a third time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
