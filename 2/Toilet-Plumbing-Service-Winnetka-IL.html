<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumbing Winnetka IL</h3>
<p>Now wait a minute, some people state, doesn't the water pressure in the water supply keep the irrigation water from reversing? Yes, most of the time it does. However, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow occurs. No, it is not a frequent incident, but it does occur more often than you think! When you don't notice the water was off for a couple of minutes, frequently it takes place at night. An example is when the water company needs to shut off the water to repair a water pipe, or attach a brand-new pipe. This makes building tasks quickly the most common cause of backflow problems. Fire battling is another common reason for backflow. Fire trucks utilize huge pumps to draw the water out of the fire hydrants. This often triggers the water pressure in the surrounding areas to drop, and backflow will occur in the surrounding areas.</p>
