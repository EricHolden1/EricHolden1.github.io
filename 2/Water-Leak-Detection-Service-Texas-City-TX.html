<p>Responsive circulation innovation works by continuously bringing tanks off-line and on-line in reaction to the water demands of your carwash. For instance, in a four-tank MTS setup with responsive circulation technology, just one of the four tanks is needed to soften water when the carwash isn't busy. However, more tanks come online as the wash bays fill. This responsive design allows the MTS to consume to 50% less salt and 38% less regeneration water than conventional single-tank or twin alternating systems.</p>

<p>Eliminate scratchy rashes and experience smoother, softer skin and hair with a point-of-use shower head water softener. These models attach to or replace your existing shower head to balance the pH of your water, stop scale from forming, and filter out minerals. The majority of people dump food waste in the garbage, which implies more garbage to go in landfills or be incinerated. Besides being bad for the environment, it's often stinky and commonly uses plastic bags to bring the waste. Worse, food waste can ferment in landfills rather of breaking down.</p>

<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is just half the equation! To simply put some media inside a tank and hope for the very best is common in our market and lots of companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Once again, years of experience and extensive testing led us to develop a tank that fluidizes the media bed better than any other design on the marketplace. Fluidization is the essential to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the solidity in the water to calcite crystals which will not stay with anything even under severe temperature levels. It's only with the media and the fluidization correctly collaborating that you can achieve this.</p>
