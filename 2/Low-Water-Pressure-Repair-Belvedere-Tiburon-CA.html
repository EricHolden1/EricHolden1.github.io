Mineral accumulation can trigger constraints on the water system lines which can affect the water pressure entering into our homes. Old and worn pipe joints can easily corrode and become weak in time leaving them vulnerable to splitting and breaking. Little leakages from old worn out pipes can trigger water damage which promotes the development of mold and mildew which can posture a health threat to you and your family.

<p>Responsive circulation innovation works by continuously bringing tanks off-line and online in reaction to the water demands of your carwash. For example, in a four-tank MTS setup with responsive circulation technology, just one of the four tanks is required to soften water when the carwash isn't busy. Nevertheless, more tanks come online as the wash bays fill up. This responsive design allows the MTS to use up to 50% less salt and 38% less regrowth water than conventional single-tank or twin alternating systems.</p>
