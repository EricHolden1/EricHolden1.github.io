<p>Tru-Soft ® Solar Brine Blocks are produced for the requirements of many water softener units. Current Review: Howard, the Task Supervisor, has always been useful and valuable regarding all our issues. He did the proposal and arranged the work for the clear out and partial sewer line repair quickly. It is constantly a pleasure to work with him. Derek snaked the laundry line and outside kitchen sink line which has a "Y". He was able to get a snake around the "Y", which many plumbers state they can't do, and clear the line. He is always enjoyable, professional and goes the extra mile.</p>

<p>As soon as, the gas pipe comes up from the ground (called the riser"), it can continue to be wrapped, but must then transition to galvanized. I am not exactly sure why that should be.
