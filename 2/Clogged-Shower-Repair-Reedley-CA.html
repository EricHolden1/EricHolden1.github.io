Water pressure might fail or be decreased when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is suddenly high demand on the water system (for instance, when numerous fire hydrants are opened). Minimized pressure in the pipe might permit polluted water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
<p>Release piping linked to a storm sewer shall be equipped with backwater check valve. In commercial applications, for instance, AWWA M-14: Backflow Prevention and Cross-Connection Control Recommended Practices advises a DCV assembly on damp or dry lawn sprinkler unless there is a danger of a high-hazard cross-connection. In those cases, an RPZ assembly is recommended.</p>
