<h3>What Do I Do If a Faucet Leaks at Glenview IL?</h3>
<p>Deterioration is a complex phenomenon and there are many factors that speed up deterioration in the drinking-water circulation system and property plumbing. For many years, there has been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and deterioration, making it crucial to compare naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is corrosive as it has a low pH and low TDS; however, cation -exchange water softening does not contribute to any factors that speed up deterioration Likewise, there is an absence of scientific proof supporting the claim that hard-water scale is an efficient type of deterioration control. Thus, considering all these elements, in addition to results from research studies, WQA's position is that an appropriately set up cation -exchange water softener does not make water more corrosive.</p>
