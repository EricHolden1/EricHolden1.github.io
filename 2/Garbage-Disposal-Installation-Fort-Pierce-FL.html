<p>A partial reroute is generally a little scale repiping of several afflicted locations of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost efficient, it is possible to only desert the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, walls and attics. Costing less than a full repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have actually experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can accumulate in cost extremely quickly. This is the main reason we will suggest a full repipe in specific communities, based upon our experience.</p>
