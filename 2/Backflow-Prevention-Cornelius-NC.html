<p>Water softeners resolve a process called ion exchange which removes calcium and magnesium from the water. When the hard water participates in the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, usually made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, indicating they have a negative charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a positive charge, making them cations. Given that opposite charges draw in, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is brought in to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the tough water travels through the resin, the beads grab ahold of the mineral ions and remove them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the sodium ion is launched. The column of resin strips all the hardness out of the water as it goes through the mineral tank, and softened water flows out into your house.</p>
