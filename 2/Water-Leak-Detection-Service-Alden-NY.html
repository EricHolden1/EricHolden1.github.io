<p>Yes, we've all existed, when the toilet clogs and we're left feeling defenseless without the power to flush! A clog usually includes increasing water, followed by panic and plunging. There's likely a larger problem of blockage in the drain or sewer-line if this is a common occurrence. Our plumbers can assist you to determine and eliminate the problem-- quick.</p>
<p>Though it's not constantly required, in some cases the plumber might have to update or repair electrical wiring to power the brand-new garbage disposal. This normally costs an additional $50 to $100+. The pilot burner might need to be relit, the gas line might be clogged or need repair. The flowers or greenery near the gas leak will be blemished or deteriorated if the gas line is damaged. Contact our professionals to figure out the level of the problem.</p>
<p>New homes built with copper pipes are especially susceptible to destructive water conditions due to the fact that the copper pipes have not had an opportunity to become coated within. As suggested by the MDH, it is best NOT to soften the water in a new house for a duration of 3 to 5 months after occupancy. This can be done by just bypassing the water softener's filter medium. See your owner's handbook for directions on bypassing your softener. Many new houses are constructed with PEX and not copper.</p>
