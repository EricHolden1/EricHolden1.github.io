<p>Most homes or structures that were built in the 1970s usually have galvanized piping. With time, the plumbing system can wear out and the pipes can start to rust. This can cause low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have actually been coded with zinc to provide weather condition protection. As the outer finish of zinc starts to wear down, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, triggering the iron to ultimately rust.</p>
<p>Likewise, if you have a 2-story house, it'll be more expensive to repipe because the plumber will have to browse through walls to do the task. Repiping plumbing lines in your home is a big job - and it's a job you want to get right. However the series of plumbing pipe materials to pick from can make it confusing. Here we take a look at a few of the attributes of the significant pipe types to help you choose the right pipe for your plumbing.</p>
