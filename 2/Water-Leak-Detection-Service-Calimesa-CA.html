See your owner's handbook for instructions on bypassing your softener. Numerous new houses are built with PEX and not copper.</p>

<h3>Plumbing Services Around Calimesa CA</h3>
<p>The most efficient way to deal with hard water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the solidity ions-- are collected by tiny resin beads through a process called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When difficult water can be found in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and replaced with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>A water conditioner, on the other hand, handles difficult water problems in a more innovative way. It can change the way minerals behave while dissolved in the water. While the minerals are still present for any health advantages, they do not develop on surfaces and in plumbing components. Keeping the minerals in the water is a good idea, as long as you can stop the destructive negative effects.</p>
