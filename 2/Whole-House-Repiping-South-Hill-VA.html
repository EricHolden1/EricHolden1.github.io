<h3>Do You Need Water Heater Repair in South Hill VA?</h3>
<p>We carry the full array of Backflow prevention options. So which should you use? The plumbers at Clarke & Rush are specialists in repipe projects, and qualified to help you make this crucial choice. We will ensure you comprehend your alternatives, the benefits and disadvantages, and make a suggestion so you can make an informed option. A garbage disposal normally plugs into a 120-volt GFCI (ground-fault circuit interruptor) outlet under the sink. If an outlet like this isn't readily available under your sink, you'll have to have an electrical contractor install one.</p>
<p>From the above description of the working of a toilet, you can see that it is made up of several mechanical parts which, with time, undergo wear and tear and might need to be replaced. Some house owners have actually taken it upon themselves to determine how to replace these parts however lots of do not understand how to do it or can not do it well. This is where Matt's Plumbing would enter into play. When in doubt, always offer us a call and we will fix any of your plumbing problems with the right tools and years of knowledge. We will normally have these parts on hand - considering this is an extremely typical issue - so you do not have to stress over purchasing them on your own.

<p>Learn if there are any lead pipes in the house. Homes that were built prior to 1986 typically have lead or galvanized plumbing. Lead, as you know, no matter how beneficial, is an environmental contaminant (note the need for unleaded gas and paint in houses that is not lead based). If you have kids, you may not wish to reside in a home that has lead pipes.</p>
<p>Single flush High Effectiveness Toilets (HETs) use 1.28 gallons per flush. The most recent dual flush HET provided by Bonney will utilize an average of 1.1 gallons per flush. This is where we disagree with InSinkErator. We suggest, as many plumbers do, to use disposals sparingly. Proper care and waste disposal unit maintenance will keep it running long past its service warranty and keep your drain lines clear.</p>
