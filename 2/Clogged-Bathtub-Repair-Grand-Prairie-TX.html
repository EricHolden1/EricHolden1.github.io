<h3>Water Heater Repair Symptoms in Grand Prairie TX</h3>
<p>Rust is a complex phenomenon and there are many factors that speed up rust in the drinking-water circulation system and facility plumbing. For many years, there has been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and corrosion, making it important to distinguish between naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is destructive as it has a low pH and low TDS; however, cation -exchange water softening does not contribute to any aspects that accelerate corrosion Also, there is an absence of clinical evidence supporting the claim that hard-water scale is an efficient kind of corrosion control. Hence, thinking about all these aspects, along with results from research studies, WQA's position is that an appropriately set up cation -exchange water softener does not make water more corrosive.</p>
