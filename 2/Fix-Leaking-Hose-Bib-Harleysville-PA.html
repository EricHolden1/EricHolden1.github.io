<p>Once the elements are put back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is all set to be pressurized. It is essential to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the downside turned off stays in the closed position. This allows the parts to relocate to their pressurized positions in an exact motion. Once the assembly is pressurized, then any collected air needs to be removed from the body. A lot of backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be removed from crucial locations in the assembly. In some designs, test dicks can be utilized to get rid of air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a place where the air will collect.</p>
