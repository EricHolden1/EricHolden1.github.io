<p>As the name recommends, a backflow preventer works to guarantee that liquids do not recede versus the required direction of flow. When used in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is utilized to make sure that water does not flow from the lawn sprinkler back into the community water supply, or other source of drinking water. Regrettably, water held in the lawn sprinkler can become contaminated. If enabled to return to the water supply, there is potential for the polluted water to become a health threat. The backflow preventer is intended to avoid water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be checked routinely for effectiveness, as well as inspected yearly by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
