<p>No other room in a house consists of as lots of pipes and plumbing fixtures as the bathroom. Whether you need electric, gas, or tankless water heaters, we have the ideal one for your house.

<p>When compared to gas models, electrical models are much easier and less costly to install as electrical power is already offered through the main power supply line. For gas water heaters, a specific gas line needs to be set up and a viable source of gas developed. Another function of an electrical water heater is that they do not need any ventilation.

<p>The Last Jeopardy answer, you ask? The device that regulates water circulation in your toilet. If you look behind your toilet, you'll see a supply line that runs from the outlet in the wall to the bottom of the toilet fill valve. This is how water enters your toilet. After you flush the toilet, the fill valve opens to fill up the water in the toilet and the tank bowl, readying the system for the next flush. If your fill valve is broken, not set at the correct level, or isn't installed correctly, you may experience an often or constantly "running" toilet - which can cost you hundreds of dollars in wasted water.</p>
