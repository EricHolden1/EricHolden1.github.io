<p>When choosing the correct system protection there are numerous factors to consider we need to look at. In my mind there is no one size fits all scenarios in the cross-connection world. Each and every installation must be taken a look at on a private basis as an unique stand-alone system.

The backflow protection requirements for these two examples would likewise vary greatly.</p>
