Dissolved calcium and magnesium precipitate out of hard water as scale, which develops on the within pipes, hot water heater, tea kettles, coffee machine and industrial machinery. Scale lowers flow through pipes and is a poor conductor of heat. Ultimately, pipes can become totally clogged.</p>
<p>Water softeners resolve a process called ion exchange which gets rid of calcium and magnesium from the water. When the hard water participates in the mineral tank, it flows through a bed of round resin beads These plastic beads, generally made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion.

As the difficult water travels through the resin, the beads grab ahold of the mineral ions and eliminate them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the sodium ion is launched.
