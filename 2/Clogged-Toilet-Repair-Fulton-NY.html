When one has actually failed, avb's are not testable and it is not possible to identify.</p>

<p>Foul Sewer Odor: Among the first most obvious signs of a sewer concern is a smell of sewage when you flush the toilet, or in the backyard (in the area where your sewer line would be). This can be a basic problem such as a broken water seal, or it can suggest a bigger concern such as a broken sewer pipe. Drain repairs can avoid major damage to your home.

Scalding water is usually the result of a damaged pressure relief valve or a bad thermostat. In either case, scalding water is dangerous and need to be right away resolved by a qualified plumbing professional.</p>
