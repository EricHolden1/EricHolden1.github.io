<p>Woodbury, together with lots of other neighborhoods and organizations, has discovered the very best method to avoid these spots from taking place is by reducing the number of times your water softener regrows. "Restoring" describes the method softeners clean all the calcium and magnesium mineral deposits out of the filter medium when it becomes "tired" or full. However, many water softeners restore too often, when the filter medium really isn't full.
