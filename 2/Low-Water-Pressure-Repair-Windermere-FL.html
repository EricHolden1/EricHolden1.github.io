Rather than a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to effectively get used to your company' circulation rates throughout the day. During durations of high flow demand, tanks come on-line to add flow rate capability. During periods of low circulation need, tanks go off-line.
