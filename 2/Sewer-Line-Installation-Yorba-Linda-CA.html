<p>When pipes are arranged into a vertical type it is described as a hydrostatic loop. In this configuration the loop should be higher than 33 feet to operate properly. When created this way it avoids siphoning and backflow into a water supply.

<p>The easiest mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a moveable disc connected to an atmospheric vent. In case of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop below that of the outside air. This activates the disc to open, permitting air to restore and enter the valve pressure comparable to ambient climatic requirement. This restoration of pressure breaks the siphon and avoids cross contamination.</p>

<p>I had a major sewer problem with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was supporting into the basement shower. I began calling any number I could discover on Google. I really got their number for another company that couldn't come soon enough but referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and offer me an estimate. They instantly cleared the preliminary blockage, allowing for the tenants to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon further examination, there was a considerable obstruction that needed excavation to examine. His group was on website the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this initial problem and installing a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This took place yet a third time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
