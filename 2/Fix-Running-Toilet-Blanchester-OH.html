<p>The High Voltage Leak Detection Innovation (HVLD) testing process consists of a set of electrode probes which scans a sealed container made from a non-conductive material. Some disposer units do not come with a power cord attached. If this holds true, eliminate the plate with a screwdriver to access the electrical wiring (Image 1). Be sure to acquire a wiring set with the correct power score and hardware for your disposer system (Images 2 and 3). Make sure the cable is long enough to reach the receptacle without stretching the cable when you connect the electrical wiring harness to the disposer.</p>
