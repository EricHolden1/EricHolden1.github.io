<p>Foul Sewer Odor: Among the first most obvious indications of a sewer concern is a smell of sewage when you flush the toilet, or in the lawn (in the area where your sewer line would be). This can be an easy issue such as a broken water seal, or it can suggest a bigger problem such as a broken sewer pipe. Drain repairs can prevent serious damage to your house. Even if the issue stems with the municipal system, it's still smart to bring in the specialists to restrict the damage to your home.</p>
<p>The drains in the typical house get consistent usage. Hair, food scraps, soap residue, and other debris can slowly build up in time.

<p>Conventional tank-type water heaters consist of steel cylinders that are fed by a pipes that dips into a large tank. The water inside this tank is warmed up and after that launched into the pipes of your house through a hot-water pipe on top of the tank. Another pipe that emerges from the tank includes the temperature and pressure-relief valve, which opens if you surpass a pre-programmed level. You'll also discover a drain valve near the tank bottom, and a control unit outside for setting temperature levels and managing the pilot-light valve.</p>
