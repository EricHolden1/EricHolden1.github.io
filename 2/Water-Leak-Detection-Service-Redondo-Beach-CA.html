Merely pour a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, add some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mix sit for a while. If that does not work, you can attempt a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner. Many of these cleaners consist of focused levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be extremely harmful if it is available in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. Please make sure to take the appropriate precautions if using one of these products.</p>

We constantly offer comprehensive upfront quotes so you know exactly what you're paying for.

It's prevalent for a toilet to have broken parts at some time which causes the toilet to run. What they indicate is the toilet will not stop running when somebody says a toilet is running.
