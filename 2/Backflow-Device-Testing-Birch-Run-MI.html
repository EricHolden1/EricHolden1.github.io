<p>I had a major sewer problem with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was supporting into the basement shower. I started calling any number I could find on Google. I really received their number for another company that could not come soon enough but referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to examine and provide me a price quote. They instantly cleared the preliminary obstruction, permitting the occupants to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon more investigation, there was a significant clog that required excavation to examine. His team was on website the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this preliminary problem and installing a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a 3rd time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
