<p>Lots of bad things are being said on this short article about liners. I find that lots of old time plumbers are not educated on liners and have no idea on what they are stating.

If this heater is set up in a house with multiple restrooms, the piping process adds to the installation costs.</p>
<p>A. The toilet fill valve measurements we show are determined from the inside bottom of the tank to the top of the fill valve. The threaded water supply shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not included in this measurement. The addition of a backflow preventer lowers water service pressure to the structure; extra, more significant expenses can occur if the drop in water pressure becomes a concern for homeowners.
