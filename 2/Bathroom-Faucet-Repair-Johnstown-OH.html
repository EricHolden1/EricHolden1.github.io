When figuring out the hardness of water, there are varieties of grains per gallon (gpg). Rinckey stated that both Belding and Greenville city water steps around 18 gpg, which is considered exceptionally tough water, leaving indicators like spotty glasses and soap residue that is next to difficult to get rid of. With well water, these signs might also be paired with iron discolorations and sulfur-smells coming from the tap.</p>
<p>Have steel or iron piping and notification rust-colored water coming from your water home appliances? This is a great sign that your pipes may be rusting from the within and therefore, need to be changed.
