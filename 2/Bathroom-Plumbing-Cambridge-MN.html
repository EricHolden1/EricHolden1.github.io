<p>When pressure in a water system surpasses the pressure in the safe and clean system offering the cosmetics water, backpressure is created. This can require the potable water to reverse its direction of circulation through the cross-connection in between the 2 systems. Possible impurities can then go into the potable water supply. The best way to decrease build-up is have a professional flush it a minimum of once a year. In some locations of Virginia, where the water is particularly difficult with high mineral content, you might need to flush the hot water heater regularly.</p>
<p>I had a major sewer concern with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I started calling any number I could find on Google. I in fact received their number for another company that could not come soon enough but referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and offer me a quote. They immediately cleared the preliminary blockage, enabling the renters to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon further investigation, there was a significant obstruction that needed excavation to examine. His team was on site the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this preliminary concern and setting up a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a 3rd time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
