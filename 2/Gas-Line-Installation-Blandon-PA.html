A PVB is a mechanical backflow prevention assembly that consists of an independently acting, spring-loaded check valve and an individually acting, spring-loaded, air inlet valve on the discharge side of the check valve. It includes shutoff valves at each end of the assembly and is geared up with test cocks.

Even even worse, the line could collapse requiring a significant repair or replacement.</p>
