<p>Softeners primarily get rid of calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+) ions. Calcium and magnesium are often described as 'hardness minerals'.

Disconnect the wire nuts and pull the cord through the cover plate hole. For preventive maintenance, Larry & Sons offers yearly checkups on your sewer and septic systems. Our professionals thoroughly examine your whole drainage system with video camera pipe inspection to avoid future problems before they occur.
