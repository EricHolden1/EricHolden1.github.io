<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is just half the formula! To just put some media inside a tank and hope for the best is common in our industry and many companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Once again, years of experience and extensive testing led us to develop a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other design on the marketplace. Fluidization is the crucial to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media transforms the solidity in the water to calcite crystals which will not adhere to anything even under extreme temperatures. It's only with the media and the fluidization properly working together that you can attain this.</p>
