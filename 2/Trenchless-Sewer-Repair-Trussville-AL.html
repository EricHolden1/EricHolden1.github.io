<p>Backflow means the unfavorable reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the drinkable water system; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from happening. Points at which a potable water supply connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they must be thoroughly developed and installed to prevent backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>

The point is your drains all link, and once you have a backup in your main sewer line, you'll experience backup and overruning from multiple drain lines in your house.</p>
