Our comprehensive water quality program operates 24 hr a day, 365 days a year, to ensure that the water provided to our consumers is kept devoid of damaging impurities. A vital part of our water quality program is the backflow prevention program When a water line is connected to equipment containing a nonpotable substance, this is called a cross-connection. Contamination might happen when water flows through a cross-connection from a nonpotable source, such as a sprinkler system or cooling and heating system, into the drinkable water system. This can happen through a procedure referred to as backflow.</p>
