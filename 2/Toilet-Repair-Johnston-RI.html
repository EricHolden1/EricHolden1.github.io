<p>As the name recommends, a backflow preventer works to guarantee that liquids do not flow back versus the required direction of flow. When utilized in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is utilized to ensure that water does not stream from the sprinkler system back into the community supply of water, or other source of drinking water. Unfortunately, water kept in the sprinkler system can end up being infected. There is potential for the infected water to end up being a health risk if permitted to re-enter the water supply. The backflow preventer is intended to avoid water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be inspected frequently for effectiveness, as well as inspected every year by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
