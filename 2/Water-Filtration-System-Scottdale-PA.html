<p>Rust is a complicated phenomenon and there are numerous aspects that accelerate rust in the drinking-water distribution system and facility plumbing. For several years, there has actually been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and rust, making it crucial to distinguish between naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is destructive as it has a low pH and low TDS; nevertheless, cation -exchange water softening does not add to any factors that speed up corrosion Likewise, there is a lack of scientific evidence supporting the claim that hard-water scale is an efficient form of corrosion control. Thus, thinking about all these factors, in addition to arise from research study studies, WQA's position is that an appropriately set up cation -exchange water softener does not make water more destructive.</p>
<p>Regular leakages: Leakages originating from your water heater are never a great sign. If your hot water heater has frequent leaks or is constantly needing repairs, it is likely more cost-effective to replace the whole system.

Using your heater during these peak periods can increase your power bills. On the hand, gas is cheap and has a fixed rate. Another drawback of an electrical hot water heater is that they can be costly to install, particularly when it comes to whole-house tankless systems.</p>
<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is only half the equation! To simply put some media inside a tank and expect the best is common in our industry and numerous companies try to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Once again, years of experience and thorough testing led us to create a tank that fluidizes the media bed better than any other style on the market. Fluidization is the crucial to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the hardness in the water to calcite crystals which will not stay with anything even under severe temperatures.
