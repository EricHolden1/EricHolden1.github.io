<p>Backpressure backflow is brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean water supply pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a mix of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in drinkable supply of water pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being used surpasses the amount of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
