They replaced my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always dripped in the past if I turned off the water under the sink.

Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was quite reasonable. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing needs.
