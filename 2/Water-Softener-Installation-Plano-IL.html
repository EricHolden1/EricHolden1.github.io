<p>In the long run, a gas heater may be a cheaper alternative than an electric, however the preliminary cost of the heater and the installation can be considerably higher.

<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is only half the equation! To just put some media inside a tank and expect the very best is typical in our industry and numerous companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Again, years of experience and comprehensive testing led us to design a tank that fluidizes the media bed better than any other style on the market. Fluidization is the essential to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the solidity in the water to calcite crystals which will not stick to anything even under extreme temperature levels. It's only with the media and the fluidization properly interacting that you can accomplish this.</p>
