No, it is not a frequent incident, however it does happen regularly than you think! Often it occurs during the night when you do not discover the water was off for a couple of minutes. An example is when the water company has to shut off the water to repair a pipes, or hook up a new pipe. This makes building jobs easily the most common reason for backflow problems. Fire combating is another typical cause of backflow. Fire trucks utilize substantial pumps to draw the water out of the fire hydrants. This often causes the water pressure in the surrounding areas to drop, and backflow will occur in the surrounding areas.</p>
