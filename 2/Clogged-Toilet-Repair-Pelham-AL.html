For extra questions please call 770-730-5600. Wm. Henderson Plumbing, Heating & Cooling Inc. uses piping services in Delaware County & The Main Line. A common protective device called a backflow preventer (BFP) can be installed within the plumbing system to effectively shut-off the house or organisation from the street sewer system during sewage back-ups.</p>
<p>If there is backflow at your home, you might contaminate your drinking water with non-treated water from an irrigation canal or water pooled around a sprinkler head that has fertilizer on it. Likewise, if you use your hose to fill a wading pool or jacuzzi, a reversal of the water flow might siphon pool or health spa chemicals back through the garden hose and into your home's plumbing.</p>
<h3>Garden Sprinkler Systems in Pelham Alabama</h2>
<p>DCVs are particularly created to prevent backflow in fire sprinkler systems. The essential for regular fire security applications, DCVs feature an inlet (upstream) shutoff valve, 2 independently operating spring-loaded check valves (generally inside a single valve body), 4 test cocks, and an outlet (downstream) shutoff valve. Light-duty commercial-grade garbage disposals start around $500-$ 2,500 and go up depending upon size, brand name and features.</p>
