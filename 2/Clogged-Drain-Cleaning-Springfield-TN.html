<p>As explained previously in the post, carbon monoxide is completely odor free and colorless. The only test for it is a carbon monoxide detector. Every home needs to have carbon monoxide detectors set up at the correct areas. In California, it is a requirement for all multi-family and single residences to have both smoke and carbon monoxide detectors.

<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is only half the equation! To simply put some media inside a tank and wish for the very best is normal in our industry and many companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Again, years of experience and comprehensive testing led us to create a tank that fluidizes the media bed better than any other design on the marketplace. Fluidization is the crucial to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media transforms the solidity in the water to calcite crystals which will not adhere to anything even under severe temperature levels. It's only with the media and the fluidization appropriately interacting that you can achieve this.</p>
