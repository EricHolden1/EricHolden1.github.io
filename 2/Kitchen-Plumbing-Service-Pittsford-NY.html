When your water lines are repiped, it simply means old copper and galvanized pipes are changed with new pipes. We find that houses 15 years or older who have never had repiping work are the most likely candidates for water line replacement. You might be in need of water line repiping if you have an older house and are experiencing regular and significant leaks. We discover that repiping can actually be the more affordable and much better long-term solution if you do have regular leaks.</p>
<p>Repiping is not a short-term fix. It's an irreversible solution for the whole plumbing system in your home or company. We turn off the water system, get rid of old pipe and replace it with new pipe. After the brand-new system is installed, we turn the water on and perform tests on the new system. As soon as the system passes our tests, it's excellent to opt for you.</p>

For instance, California has stringent guidelines regarding underground gas line installation since of earthquakes and other natural catastrophes. Piping needs to be at least 18 inches listed below ground for much safer areas and 24 inches for locations at higher threat of external damage.</p>
