<p>If you resemble the majority of people, you have actually never ever even thought about it, but flushing your hot water heater can help it last longer and might save you cash on energy expenses by restoring the effectiveness of the hot water heater. Your hot water heater must be flushed as soon as a year. It might have up to 8 inches of sediment at the bottom of the tank if you have a 15‐year‐old water heater that's never been flushed. That means eight less inches of hot water, not to discuss the fact that your tap water is being heated up in a tank with calcium, scale, rust, dirt, iron, and sulfuric‐smelling bacteria.</p>
