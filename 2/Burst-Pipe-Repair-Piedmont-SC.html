<p>Aside from these 2 important components, there are a myriad of small, possibly less important things that can deteriorate or break. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will rust far more rapidly. Consistent gross smells originating from the toilet can show you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. You may need a new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting appropriately. Bulges in the supply line can burst and trigger a leak. If mishandled, tank lids can split and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed. While this will not affect the function of your toilet, it certainly does not do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by discussing all the things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a complete component and every part needs to be in great shape for it to work at its best.</p>
