<p>If you need a water softener is a personal preference, identifying. An authorization is not needed for repairs which involve only the working parts of a faucet or valve or clearance of blockages supplied changes are not made in the existing piping or components. A common water softener includes a tall, narrow water-softener tank, and a brief, wide salt water tank. The softener tank is linked to the home's water-supply line.
