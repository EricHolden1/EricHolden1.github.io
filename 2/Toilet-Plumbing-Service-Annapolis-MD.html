<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumbers Annapolis MD</h3>
<p>Now wait a minute, some individuals say, doesn't the water pressure in the water system keep the watering water from reversing? Yes, the majority of the time it does. Nevertheless, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow takes place. No, it is not a frequent occurrence, but it does occur more often than you believe! When you don't observe the water was off for a couple of minutes, frequently it happens at night. An example is when the public utility has to shut off the water to repair a pipes, or attach a new pipe. This makes construction projects quickly the most common cause of backflow problems. Fire fighting is another common cause of backflow. Fire trucks utilize substantial pumps to draw the water out of the fire hydrants. This frequently triggers the water pressure in the surrounding areas to drop, and backflow will take place in the surrounding areas.</p>
<p>Water softeners overcome a process called ion exchange which removes calcium and magnesium from the water. When the tough water enters into the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, normally made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, indicating they have an unfavorable charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a favorable charge, making them cations. Because opposite charges draw in, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is drawn in to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the difficult water travels through the resin, the beads get ahold of the mineral ions and remove them from the water. When the bead seizes the mineral ion, the sodium ion is released. The column of resin strips all the hardness out of the water as it goes through the mineral tank, and softened water drains into your home.</p>
