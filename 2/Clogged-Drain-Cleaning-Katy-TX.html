<p>Each resin bead or zeolite crystal is negatively charged and has space to hang on to favorable ions. The fresh media starts by hanging on to the weaker charged sodium ions. As hard water travels through your water softener tank, the stronger charged calcium or magnesium are pulled to the media like a magnet. Since the hardness minerals have a higher positive charge than the sodium, they will knock the sodium ions off and take their place.</p>
