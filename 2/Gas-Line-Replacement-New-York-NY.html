<p>A lot of houses or buildings that were constructed in the 1970s usually have galvanized piping. Over time, the plumbing system can wear and the pipes can begin to wear away. This can trigger low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have actually been coded with zinc to offer weather condition protection. As the external finish of zinc starts to wear down, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, triggering the iron to ultimately rust.</p>
<p>Malfunctioning drains are more than troublesome. They can be a stinky health hazard that triggers waste to support into your home.
