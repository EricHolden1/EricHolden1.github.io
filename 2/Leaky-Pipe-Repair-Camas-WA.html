While not effective in all cases, the installation of a soft seated check valve instantly ahead of the RPZ will typically hold the pressure consistent to the assembly in times of changing supply pressure.</p>
<p>A backflow preventer is a way or system to avoid backflow. The basic means of preventing backflow is an air gap, which either gets rid of a cross-connection or supplies a barrier to backflow. The standard system for preventing backflow is a mechanical backflow preventer, which offers a physical barrier to backflow. The primary kinds of mechanical backflow preventer are the reduced-pressure concept assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the check valve assembly. A secondary kind of mechanical backflow preventer is the residential double check valve.</p>
