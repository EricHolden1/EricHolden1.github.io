<p>Therefore, we see the transition from big transport pipelines (aqueducts) supplying water to whole cities to large distribution pipes (mains) servicing smaller communities or big facilities, to medium circulation pipelines and finally to little service pipelines. Each phase in the supply of water and distribution system has to deal with varying flow rates, circulation velocities and pressure heads, in addition to different levels of direct exposure to potential backwash or impurity infiltration and the subsequent need for protection with backflow preventers.</p>
<p>Tough water is softened by getting rid of the calcium and magnesium it includes. When hard water goes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (solidity) ions are gotten rid of through an ion exchange procedure, so just softened water travels through to your home. When the resin bed fills up with solidity ions, it must be regrowed (cleaned up). Salt is typically used in the regrowth process and brings back the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange process can begin once again.</p>
