<p>Concealed water leakages are frequently difficult and have Possibly Severe Repercussions. Changing your flapper may need somewhat different actions than we reveal (Pictures 2 and 3). Your flapper may screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. Discovering a replacement flapper may be the hardest part of the job if you have an unusual flush valve. To find an ideal replacement, switch off the water, take the old one with you to the house center or hardware store. (Shut off the water before removing the flapper.)
