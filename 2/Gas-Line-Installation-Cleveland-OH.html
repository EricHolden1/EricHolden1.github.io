<p>Atmospheric vacuum breakers (AVB) are the most basic design of backflow preventer. If you have less than six control valves, they are the least pricey, but also the least reliable choice. These devices are not developed as a whole-system backflow prevention valve; one need to be installed at every control valve.

<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health threat for individuals on low salt diets. Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to reduce its mineral material. Normally, this procedure includes 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending upon how hard the water was to begin with. More difficult water will result in more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this boost in salt is minor, however if you have actually been encouraged by a medical professional to follow a rigorous low sodium diet plan this increase can present problems.</p>
