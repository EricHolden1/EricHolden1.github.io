<p>While city water does get treated, it is done for purposes of eliminating bacterial problems and making the water drinkable.

<p>Backpressure backflow is brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable water system pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in safe and clean water supply pressure take place whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
