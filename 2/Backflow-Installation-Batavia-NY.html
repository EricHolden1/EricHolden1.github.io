<p>This is a bad sign. Toilets must absolutely never wobble, move, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing. If you can move a toilet around by doing anything less extreme than swinging a sledgehammer at it, that toilet should be replaced. Incorrectly seated and sealed toilets could leak, damage plumbing, or even compromise the structural stability of the house.</p>
<p>Frequent leakages: Leakages coming from your water heater are never ever a good indication. It is likely more cost-efficient to replace the whole system if your water heater has frequent leakages or is constantly requiring repairs.

Its sole task is to avoid drinking water from being contaminated due to backflow.</p>
