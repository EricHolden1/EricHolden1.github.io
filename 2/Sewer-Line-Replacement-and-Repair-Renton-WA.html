For this factor, the RPZ ought to be set up in areas that are exempt to water damage and permit adequate drainage.</p>

<p>To reduce the need of gas line repair, it is necessary to understand the common causes of gas leaks. Indoor gas leaks from heaters, stoves, ovens and other gas-burning devices take place most commonly in the winter season. This is since homes are not properly ventilated during the cooler months to prevent heat loss. We advise setting up carbon monoxide detectors outside of bedroom doors to signal you of any possible gas leakages if you have not done so already.</p>

Blanc also built a much larger variation of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal. It needed to be hauled by a truck and featured a 10 hp gasoline engine and 1000 feet of steel cable television. It was capable of cleaning large commercial and municipal sewer pipes.
