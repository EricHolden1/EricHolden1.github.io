<h3>Quality Plumbing Services In Dover NH</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adapt to your service' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high circulation demand, tanks come on-line to add flow rate capacity. Throughout durations of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation technology, and it's arguably the most crucial development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
