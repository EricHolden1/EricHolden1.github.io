<p>I had a major sewer concern with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I started calling any number I could find on Google. I actually got their number for another company that couldn't come soon enough but referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to examine and provide me a price quote. They right away cleared the initial clog, allowing for the tenants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon more investigation, there was a significant blockage that needed excavation to investigate. His team was on website the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this initial issue and setting up a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This took place yet a third time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
