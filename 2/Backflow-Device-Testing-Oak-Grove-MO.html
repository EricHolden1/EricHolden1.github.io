<p>We Can Clean Your Drains. As the pipes continue to age, flakes of rust will build up in different parts of the plumbing system, the majority of typically in shower heads, faucets, and shut-off valves. This can trigger low flow problems or perhaps stop a fixture from streaming entirely. The next common issue that happens with older galvanized pipes is the arterial sclerosis" of the system, which occurs when the swelling of the pipes gets to be so severe that it lowers the available volume of water that can stream around the system.</p>
<p>Next, test the flapper as displayed in Picture 1. If additional pressure on the flapper doesn't stop the running noise, water is most likely escaping through a broken or rusted overflow tube. In that case, you need to detach the tank from the bowl and replace the whole flush valve. Considering that the overflow tube is seldom the reason for a running toilet, we won't cover that repair here.</p>
