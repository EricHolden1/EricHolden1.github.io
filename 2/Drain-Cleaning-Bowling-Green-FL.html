<p>Our Water Softeners Are Brilliantly Created To Work.

Too often we see disposal units ruined by improper installation. Taking a shortcut by installing it yourself can typically lead to a lack of efficiency and regular repairs down the line.</p>

Salt is generally used in the regeneration procedure and brings back the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange process can start once again.</p>
