<p>Before selection and installation, refer to producers literature for temperature level ranges. All assemblies must be secured from freezing temperatures and if installed where temperature levels will reach 100 degrees F or above, a hot water type assembly should be used. Seek advice from makers specs for recommendations. When searching for plumbing services in the area, be specific with your requirements and ask prospects if they are licensed plumbers and if they have the advanced experience and licenses connected with a plumbing contractor.</p>
