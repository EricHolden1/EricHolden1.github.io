<p>Deterioration: The most typical issue is deterioration in the tank and pipes that link to your water heater. This is specifically true if you have without treatment difficult water, which consists of severe minerals that can connect to the piping and tank and break down the product over time. Whether it's calcium, iron, or another component that is triggering the rust, you will ultimately experience a leak in your water heater that is tough to repair. Leakages often mean a brand-new unit replacement remains in order.</p>

In most cases, this indicates a hot water heater replacement. Arizona is notorious for having hard water, leading many property owners to invest in water softening treatments and systems. There are various benefits of water softening, but it might not be the very best option for every house. To help you make an informed decision, here's a crash course in everything you need to know about water softening.</p>

<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is just half the equation! To simply put some media inside a tank and expect the best is normal in our industry and many companies try to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Once again, years of experience and thorough testing led us to design a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other style on the market. Fluidization is the key to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the hardness in the water to calcite crystals which will not stay with anything even under extreme temperature levels. It's only with the media and the fluidization correctly working together that you can accomplish this.</p>
