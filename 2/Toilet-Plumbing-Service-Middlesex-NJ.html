<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is only half the formula! To simply pour some media inside a tank and expect the best is typical in our industry and lots of companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Again, years of experience and thorough testing led us to create a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other design on the market. Fluidization is the essential to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the hardness in the water to calcite crystals which will not stick to anything even under severe temperature levels. It's only with the media and the fluidization effectively working together that you can attain this.</p>
