<p>I had a major sewer concern with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I began calling any number I might discover on Google. I actually received their number for another company that could not come quickly enough but referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to investigate and give me an estimate. They immediately cleared the preliminary obstruction, enabling the tenants to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon further investigation, there was a considerable obstruction that needed excavation to examine. His team was on website the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this initial concern and installing a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a 3rd time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
