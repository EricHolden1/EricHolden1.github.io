When utilized in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is utilized to make sure that water does not flow from the sprinkler system back into the local water supply, or other source of drinking water.

The backflow preventer is planned to avoid water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be examined routinely for effectiveness, along with examined yearly by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
