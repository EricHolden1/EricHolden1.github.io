<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>We specialize in tub and shower replacement and full bathroom remodeling at very competitive pricing. Turn on the gas and inspect connections for leaks by brushing a 50-50 mix of dishwashing liquid and water over the joints. You have a leak if the mixture bubbles. Tighten up or reconnect joints that leak. Wipe the joints dry when finished. Call the plumbing inspector to check out your work. Follow the how-to guidance that accompanies the images to ensure the connections are tight.</p>
<p>Once the parts are placed back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is ready to be pressurized. It is very important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on slowly while the downside turned off remains in the closed position. This allows the parts to transfer to their pressurized positions in an accurate motion. As soon as the assembly is pressurized, then any collected air should be gotten rid of from the body. A lot of backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be gotten rid of from critical areas in the assembly. In some designs, test dicks can be utilized to eliminate air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a location where the air will collect.</p>
