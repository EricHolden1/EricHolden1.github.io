<p>Won't drain - The unit may not be slicing food appropriately and waste may have clogged the drain pipe. However, if there are a number of leakages within the system, or if there is evidence of corrosion in a number of places, it is probably time to repipe. A water softener is loaded with resin beads.

<p>We truly appreciate our consumers and the services that we provide. As hard water passes through a softener, the calcium and magnesium trade locations with salt ions (Figure 1). Sodium ions are held loosely and are changed easily by calcium and magnesium ions. During this procedure, free" salt ions are released into the water. The time between charging cycles depends on the hardness of the water, the quantity of water utilized, the size of the system and the capability of the exchange media to eliminate solidity.</p>
<p>You have galvanized iron pipes. I had Price Busters replace a water heater tank and a main water shut down valve. They were really responsive and timely to send me a bid which was extremely competitive. They were really professional and did an awesome job. I would certainly call them again for my plumbing needs. Now, if this staining just appears when hot water is being used, then the rust probably exists within your water heater tank and not in your pipes. This is obviously still a problem that needs to be handled immediately (you'll likely need a new water heater) however not one that needs repiping.</p>
