The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a little hole in which the water would go through. 21 The multiple pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wood pipes were used in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wooden tubes were widely used in the U.S.A. during the 20th century. These pipes (used in place of corrugated iron or reinforced concrete pipes) were made of areas cut from short lengths of wood.
