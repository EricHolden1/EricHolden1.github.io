"Regrowing" refers to the way softeners clean all the calcium and magnesium mineral deposits out of the filter medium when it ends up being "exhausted" or full.

<p>A partial reroute is basically a small scale repiping of one or more afflicted areas of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost efficient, it is possible to only abandon the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, ceilings and walls. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can add up in cost extremely rapidly. This is the main reason that we will advise a full repipe in specific communities, based on our experience.</p>
