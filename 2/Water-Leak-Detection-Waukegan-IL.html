An example is when the public utility has to shut off the water to repair a pipes, or attach a brand-new pipe. This makes building projects easily the most typical reason for backflow problems. Fire battling is another typical reason for backflow. Fire engine use substantial pumps to suck the water out of the fire hydrants. This frequently triggers the water pressure in the surrounding areas to drop, and backflow will take place in the surrounding communities.</p>

By turning a valve, you can bypass the softener in the event you need to provide some kind of maintenance to it and even while you're working on installing it. If the softener you choose does not have a bypass, then it's smart to construct one out of plumbing to bypass the equipment in case you need to keep the system.</p>
