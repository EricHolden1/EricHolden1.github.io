A common water softener includes a high, narrow water-softener tank, and a brief, large brine tank. The softener tank is connected to the house's water-supply line. A small-diameter fill tube links the salt water tank to the softener tank. And a discharge hose ranges from the softener tank to a neighboring drainpipe or drywell.</p>
<p>Set out the new disposal and parts in preparation for installation. I've been to numerous carwashes that have a softener, and to the surprise of the owners, the water tests hard even after having actually gone through the softener.

<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to run, the control valve or valves must remain open and the system should be constantly kept track of. Therefore, there is a device on each control valve that either prevents the valve from being closed or sends an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as easy as a locked chain through the control valve that prevents that valve from opening, or an alarm that alerts the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems make use of both approaches. NFPA 13 describes all such gadgets as supervisory gadgets.</p>
