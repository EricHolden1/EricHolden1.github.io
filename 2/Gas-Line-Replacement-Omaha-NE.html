<p>As the name suggests, a backflow preventer works to make sure that liquids do not recede against the required direction of flow. When utilized in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is used to make sure that water does not flow from the lawn sprinkler back into the local supply of water, or other source of drinking water. Unfortunately, water kept in the lawn sprinkler can end up being infected. If permitted to return to the water system, there is potential for the polluted water to become a health danger. The backflow preventer is planned to avoid water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be checked routinely for efficiency, as well as examined each year by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
