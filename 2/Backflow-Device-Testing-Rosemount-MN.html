<p>As the water treatment industry has actually grown in the U.S., the idea of water softening has actually typically been misconstrued as a purifying, cleansing or conditioning process. This is due mainly to overstated advertising and, in part, to customer mistaken beliefs about water treatment. However the reality is that water softening just gets rid of solidity minerals and gets rid of problems that are a problem and not a risk to human health. The decision "to soften or not to soften" refers individual choice not need. However, water softening does have benefits, and disadvantages, that make this choice a significant one.</p>
