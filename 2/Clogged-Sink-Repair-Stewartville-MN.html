<p>Improperly installed gas lines lead to gas leaks. Gas leaks are pricey to repair. Gas line installation is not a do-it-yourself project. The gas lines need to be calibrated to the ideal levels by a certified professional. The United States Department of Energy states that water heating can represent 14% -25% of the energy consumed in your home." It is the 2nd highest energy consuming area of a home, next to heating and cooling.

After they provided me the "do not pour grease down the sink" lecture and they left, I noticed they managed to reassemble the sink in such a way that the sprayer hose was twisted around the plumbing. I didn't even trouble to try calling them back, considering that I never wish to see this company once again.</p>

Piping must be at least 18 inches below ground for safer areas and 24 inches for places at greater risk of external damage.</p>
