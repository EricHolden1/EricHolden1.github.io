<p>We had an excellent experience with Joe Boyette, he was really professional, polite, proficient. We had a lot of plumbing repair after a fire for over a 2 month period. We also had to replace a water and a bathroom heater unassociated to the fire, but we felt confident in Joe's capabilities. We made the decision to stick with Joe, although we felt Mr Rooter costs were certainly on the luxury. This being published by Barbara Boyer from Atlanta.</p>
