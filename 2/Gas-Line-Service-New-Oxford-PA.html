<p>The toilet takes a really long time to flush. Here's how it works: Throughout typical operation, the pressure between the two check valves-- referred to as the zone of lowered pressure-- is kept at a lower pressure than the supply pressure. If either check valve must leak, the relief valve is designed to discharge and open water to the outdoors, ensuring backflow never takes place.</p>
