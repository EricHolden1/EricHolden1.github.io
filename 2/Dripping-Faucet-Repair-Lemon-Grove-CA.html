<p>Backflow preventers ought to just be repaired when the information gathered from the field test suggests the assembly has degraded in its performance listed below the developed minimum standard. The test treatment is a diagnostic evaluation of the workings of a backflow preventer.

These minimum standards are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly starts to degrade in its performance, it can still avoid backflow. The purpose of a repair is to return the assembly back to its initial factory working requirements. This implies the assembly is fixed so that it can carry out above the minimum standard.</p>
