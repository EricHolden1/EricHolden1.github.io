<p>Covert water leaks are frequently demanding and have Possibly Serious Consequences. Replacing your flapper may require somewhat various steps than we show (Photos 2 and 3). Your flapper might screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. Discovering a replacement flapper may be the hardest part of the task if you have an uncommon flush valve. To find an ideal replacement, turn off the water, take the old one with you to the house center or hardware shop. (Shut off the water prior to removing the flapper.) You might not discover an identical match, but chances are you'll locate one of the very same shape and diameter. If not, attempt a plumbing supply store (in the Telephone Directory under Plumbing Products") or search online.</p>
