<p>A water softener is a whole-house filtration system that removes hardness-causing calcium and magnesium minerals from your water through a process called ion exchange.  A water softener addresses one of the most terrible and widespread water problems: hard water.  Tough water ruined the modern-day house. Scale builds up in your pipes, obstructing them and reducing water pressure.  Scale considerably shortens the lifespan of appliances like dishwashing machines, coffee makers and ice devices.
