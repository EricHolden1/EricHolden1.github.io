<p>A water softener is a whole-house filtration system that removes hardness-causing calcium and magnesium minerals from your water through a process called ion exchange.  A water softener addresses one of the most terrible and widespread water problems: hard water.  Tough water ruined the modern-day house. Scale builds up in your pipes, obstructing them and reducing water pressure.  Scale considerably shortens the lifespan of appliances like dishwashing machines, coffee makers and ice devices. Tough water ruins warm water home appliances.
