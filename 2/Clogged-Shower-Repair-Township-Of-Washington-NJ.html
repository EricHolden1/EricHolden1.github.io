<h3>How to Fix a Leaky Faucet in the Kitchen in Township Of Washington NJ</h3>
<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to operate, the control valve or valves must remain open and the system must be continuously kept an eye on. For that reason, there is a device on each control valve that either prevents the valve from being closed or sends an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as basic as a locked chain through the control valve that avoids that valve from opening, or an alarm system that alerts the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems make use of both techniques. NFPA 13 describes all such devices as supervisory gadgets.</p>
