<p>The economics of new high-efficiency water softeners. A clogged drain can make any of your plumbing components inoperable. Whether you have a sink that doesn't drain correctly or a shower that holds water for too long, a Sears Handyman can help. Often drain repair needs can be fixed relatively rapidly by an experienced handyman. At other times, however, portions of a drain may need to be disassembled, taken a look at, and cleared before being changed. Sometimes, a handyman might determine that a replacement part is needed (like a tailpiece, pvc, or reducer  trap) to ensure normal operation for your drain. Call a Sears Handyman representative today to discuss repair options.</p>
