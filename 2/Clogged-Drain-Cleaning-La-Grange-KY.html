<h3>La Grange KY Experts In Unclogging Drains</h3>
<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to operate, the control valve or valves must remain open and the system must be continually kept track of. For that reason, there is a device on each control valve that either prevents the valve from being closed or sends an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as simple as a locked chain through the control valve that prevents that valve from opening, or an alarm that informs the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems utilize both methods. NFPA 13 refers to all such devices as supervisory gadgets.</p>
<p>When it comes to plumbing and maintenance, sewer video inspection is among the best ways to remain ahead of the game.
