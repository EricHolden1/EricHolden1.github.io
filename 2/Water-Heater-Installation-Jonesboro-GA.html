<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable water system pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in safe and clean supply of water pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being used surpasses the amount of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
