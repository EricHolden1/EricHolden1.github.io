Even if you take great care of your drains by covering them and avoiding putting any liquid fat, oil, and grease down them, in some cases obstructions are inevitable.

<p>The most basic mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a moveable disc attached to an atmospheric vent. In the event of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop below that of the outside air.

This restoration of pressure breaks the siphon and prevents cross contamination.</p>
