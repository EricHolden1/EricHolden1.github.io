Even if you take great care of your drains by covering them and avoiding putting any liquid fat, oil, and grease down them, in some cases obstructions are inevitable.

<p>The most basic mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a moveable disc attached to an atmospheric vent. In the event of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop below that of the outside air. This triggers the disc to open, permitting air to go into the valve and restore pressure comparable to ambient atmospheric requirement. This restoration of pressure breaks the siphon and prevents cross contamination.</p>
