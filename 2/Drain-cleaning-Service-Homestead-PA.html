<p>In the majority of states, other than Kansas, you are accountable for any gas piping on your property from our gas meter to your house or service. Atmos Energy does not maintain the natural gas lines on your home beyond our meter, this is the very same as other utilities, such as your electrical wiring and water pipes. When water enters your home from the main supply of water line, it should just ever flow in one direction: into your home.</p>
<p>Plumbers, pipefitters, and steamfitters finish an apprenticeship program and pass the needed licensing test to end up being journey-level employees. Journey-level plumbers, pipefitters, and steamfitters are certified to perform jobs independently. Plumbers with a number of years of plumbing experience who pass another exam earn master status. Some states need master plumber status in order to obtain a plumbing contractor's license.</p>
