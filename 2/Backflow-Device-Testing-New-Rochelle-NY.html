<p>I had a major sewer problem with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was supporting into the basement shower. I began calling any number I might find on Google. I actually got their number for another company that could not come soon enough but referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to examine and provide me an estimate. They instantly cleared the preliminary blockage, permitting the occupants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon additional examination, there was a significant clog that needed excavation to examine. His team was on site the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this preliminary problem and installing a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a 3rd time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
