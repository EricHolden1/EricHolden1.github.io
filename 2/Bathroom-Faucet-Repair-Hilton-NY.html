Big amounts of food can quickly overwhelm the system and cause a substantial clog. That's why Pratt Plumbing receives many phone calls requesting waste disposal unit repairs and maintenance.</p>
<p>The HydroFLOW water conditioner keeps minerals, algae, and germs from ending up being a problem in your water supply by sending out an electrical signal of 150 kilohertz (kHz) through your plumbing system. The signal causes the minerals to join together, forming clusters that ultimately form steady crystals. These crystals do not cling to surfaces like specific minerals would.</p>
