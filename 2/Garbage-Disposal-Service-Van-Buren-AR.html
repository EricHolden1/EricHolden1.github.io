After just one week of constant testing with tough water, more than three-fourths of shower head nozzles ended up being clogged, according to lab results. Shower heads using water treated by a water softening system, on the other hand, performed almost as well as on the day they were installed.</p>
<p>Drain pipe is not secured using the required solvent cement (end of the pipe ought to be cut straight). ABS fitting is glued to PVC pipe. ABS and PVC are not really glued in the routine sense of gluing. The so-called "glue" is really a solvent that melts the surface areas of the pipe and fitting for a couple of seconds. Broken Pipes: Pipes are split, punctured or collapsed by moving soil, frozen ground, settling, etc</p>

Friendly, communicated well, absolutely responsive and truly cared to assist me through this extremely difficult task. All of individuals I encountered were good example for what a well run service business need to be. Much thanks and appreciation. You're fantastic.</p>
