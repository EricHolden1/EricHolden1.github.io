<p>Whether replacing an old one or putting one in for the first time, there are a couple of things worth knowing about garbage disposal installation.

<p>Fixing a leaky faucet seems like a simple job, but often times the scenario can be deceptively made complex.

<h3>Clogged Toilet in Poughkeepsie New York</h2>
<p>A partial reroute is essentially a small scale repiping of one or more affected areas of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost efficient, it is possible to just abandon the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, ceilings and attics. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have actually experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can add up in cost really quickly. This is the main reason why we will advise a full repipe in specific areas, based upon our experience.</p>
