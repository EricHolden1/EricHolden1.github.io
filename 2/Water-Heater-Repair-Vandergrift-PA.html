<p>You have galvanized iron pipes. I had Price Busters replace a hot water heater tank and a main water turned off valve. They were prompt and very responsive to send me a bid which was really competitive. They were extremely professional and did an awesome task.

Now, if this discoloration only appears when hot water is being utilized, then the rust most likely exists within your hot water heater tank and not in your pipes. This is obviously still a problem that requires to be dealt with immediately (you'll likely need a brand-new hot water heater) but not one that needs repiping.</p>
